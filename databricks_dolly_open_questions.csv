What is underwriting?,"Underwriting (UW) services are provided by some large financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies and investment houses, whereby they guarantee payment in case of damage or financial loss and accept the financial risk for liability arising from such guarantee. An underwriting arrangement may be created in a number of situations including insurance, issues of security in a public offering, and bank lending, among others. The person or institution that agrees to sell a minimum number of securities of the company for commission is called the underwriter.

The term ""underwriting"" derives from the Lloyd's of London insurance market. Financial backers (or risk takers), who would accept some of the risk on a given venture (historically a sea voyage with associated risks of shipwreck) in exchange for a premium, would literally write their names under the risk information that was written on a Lloyd's slip created for this purpose."

"Who are ''The Lumières"" ?","The Lumières (literally in English: The Lights) was a cultural, philosophical, literary and intellectual movement beginning in the second half of the 17th century, originating in western Europe and spreading throughout the rest of Europe. It included philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza, David Hume, John Locke, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot, Pierre Bayle and Isaac Newton. This movement is influenced by the scientific revolution in southern Europe arising directly from the Italian renaissance with people like Galileo Galilei. Over time it came to mean the Siècle des Lumières, in English the Age of Enlightenment.[Note 1]

Members of the movement saw themselves as a progressive élite, and battled against religious and political persecution, fighting against what they saw as the irrationality, arbitrariness, obscurantism and superstition of the previous centuries. They redefined the study of knowledge to fit the ethics and aesthetics of their time. Their works had great influence at the end of the 18th century, in the American Declaration of Independence and the French Revolution.

This intellectual and cultural renewal by the Lumières movement was, in its strictest sense, limited to Europe. These ideas were well understood in Europe, but beyond France the idea of ""enlightenment"" had generally meant a light from outside, whereas in France it meant a light coming from within oneself.

In the most general terms, in science and philosophy, the Enlightenment aimed for the triumph of reason over faith and belief; in politics and economics, the triumph of the bourgeois over nobility and clergy."

There are many aspects that make formula one cars fast, below are the top few

1. Engine:  F1 cars have extremely powerful engines that can generate around 1000 bhp at up to 20,000 rpm
2. Power-to-Weight ratio: F1 cars are also extremely light at around 800 kgs giving them a power-to-weight ratio of 12000-1400 hp/ton. For comparison, the best Porsche cars have a power-to-weight ratio of only 300-400 hp/ton.
2. Aerodynamics: F1 cars are fitted with extremely sophisticated aerodynamics including a rear wing, front wing and body parts that help reduce aerodynamic drag for straight-line speeds while adding downforce to help around corners
3. Tires: F1 tires are extremely large and sticky. This help the cars stick to the road as the car goes through turns very fast.
4. Brakes: Lastly F1 brakes are very powerful and can slow down a car extremely quickly. This allows F1 cars to be at top speed for much longer before needing to slow down for taking a turn."

Why are so many US Hollywood films made in the state of Georgia?,"While film in the United States as an audience artform started in New York it moved to Los Angeles for the stated reason of longer and sunnier days.  Another part of the story was a patent dispute in 1898 between Thomas Edison and his patent for the Kinetograph.  Edison stated that he effectively had a say in how films were made and wanted royalties for their use.  Moving from New York near where Edison was based to Los Angeles was a simple way to grow the industry and distance themselves from a patent war.  

This mobility at the start of the modern film era due to costs continued through the 1960's and 1970's with westerns being shot in Spain.  The 1980's and 1990's continued this trend primarily shooting in Canada or Mexico.  At the turn of the century state legislators in the United States started provided steep tax rebates.  The practical outworking of this is studios are encouraged to hire local talent and use local services when producing their film.  The ratios for these rebates is fairly complicated and have created a new industry of tax professionals serving the film industry.

So then why Georgia?  Georgia currently provides one of the highest incentive structures at 20% with minimal restrictions on talent and a very low minimum budget of $500,000."

6. Place your vase in a shady spot and you're done!"
Wat id DNA annotation?,"DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying the locations of genes and all of the coding regions in a genome and determining what those genes do. An annotation (irrespective of the context) is a note added by way of explanation or commentary. Once a genome is sequenced, it needs to be annotated to make sense of it. Genes in a eukaryotic genome can be annotated using various annotation tools such as FINDER. A modern annotation pipeline can support a user-friendly web interface and software containerization such as MOSGA. Modern annotation pipelines for prokaryotic genomes are Bakta, Prokka and PGAP.

For DNA annotation, a previously unknown sequence representation of genetic material is enriched with information relating genomic position to intron-exon boundaries, regulatory sequences, repeats, gene names and protein products. This annotation is stored in genomic databases such as Mouse Genome Informatics, FlyBase, and WormBase. Educational materials on some aspects of biological annotation from the 2006 Gene Ontology annotation camp and similar events are available at the Gene Ontology website.

The National Center for Biomedical Ontology develops tools for automated annotation of database records based on the textual descriptions of those records.

As a general method, dcGO has an automated procedure for statistically inferring associations between ontology terms and protein domains or combinations of domains from the existing gene/protein-level annotations."

What is a Gross domestic product (GDP)?,"Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced and sold in a specific time period by a country or countries, generally ""without double counting the intermediate goods and services used up to produce them"". GDP is most often used by the government of a single country to measure its economic health. Due to its complex and subjective nature, this measure is often revised before being considered a reliable indicator. GDP (nominal) per capita does not, however, reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries; therefore, using a basis of GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP) may be more useful when comparing living standards between nations, while nominal GDP is more useful comparing national economies on the international market. Total GDP can also be broken down into the contribution of each industry or sector of the economy. The ratio of GDP to the total population of the region is the per capita GDP (also called the Mean Standard of Living)."

What is the FA Cup?,"The Football Association Challenge Cup, more commonly known as the FA Cup, is an annual knockout football competition in men's domestic English football. First played during the 1871–72 season, it is the oldest national football competition in the world. It is organised by and named after The Football Association (The FA). Since 2015, it has been known as The Emirates FA Cup after its headline sponsor. A concurrent Women's FA Cup has been held since 1970.

The competition is open to all eligible clubs down to Level 9 of the English football league system with Level 10 clubs acting as stand-ins in the event of non-entries from above. Included in the competition are 20 professional clubs in the Premier League (level 1), 72 professional clubs in the English Football League (levels 2 to 4), and all clubs in steps 1–5 of the National League System (levels 5 to 9) as well as a tiny number of step 6 clubs acting as stand-ins for non-entries above. A record 763 clubs competed in 2011–12. The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final. Entrants are not seeded, although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds – the minimum number of games needed to win, depending on which round a team enters the competition, ranges from six to fourteen.

The first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, from which 32 teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues One and Two. The last entrants are the Premier League and Championship clubs, into the draw for the Third Round Proper. In the modern era, only one non-League team has ever reached the quarter-finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final. As a result, significant focus is given to the smaller teams who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely ""giant-killing"" victory.

Winners receive the FA Cup trophy, of which there have been two designs and five actual cups; the latest is a 2014 replica of the second design, introduced in 1911. Winners also qualify for the UEFA Europa League and a place in the upcoming FA Community Shield. Arsenal are the most successful club with fourteen titles and Arsène Wenger is the most successful manager in the history of the competition, having won seven finals as Arsenal's manager.

Liverpool are the current holders, having beaten Chelsea 6–5 on penalties following a 0–0 draw in the 2022 final."

How is data engineering different from data science?,"Data Engineering occurs before data science in the data lifecycle. Data can be generated from various sources and this raw data may be structured, semi structured or even unstructured. To make sense of this data, data has to be ingested and transformed. This is when data engineering comes into picture. Data engineering includes the process of extracting the raw data, ingesting data into a system like a data lake, transforming the data for business needs and finally loading it into a table. This is commonly known as ELT (Extract-Load-Transform). ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) is also possible where transformation happens before the loading stage.
Data Science and Analytics is the next step in the data lifecycle. Once the data needed for specific business need is available, data scientists use this data to run machine learning models to find the most accurate model. This data is available to the data scientists in the form of tables. Data analysts also use this data to do some exploratory analysis and create dashboards. 
In essence, the data lifecycle would look as follows:
Raw data from different sources -> Data Engineering -> Data Science and Analytics"

In contrast, it can be challenging to get around many cities in the United States without a car.

Are the Golden State Warriors a good basketball team?,"The Golden State Warriors won the most recent NBA championship in 2022.  In the last 8 years they reached the NBA finals 6 times, won 4 championships, and set the record for regular seasons wins with 73.  Stephen Curry, the Warriors best player, also won the NBA Most Valuable Player award twice during that same span.  This success is generally regarded as a dynasty, a term used to describe a dominating team over a long period.

However, this season the Warriors have struggled.  Despite winning the most recent NBA championship only 9 months ago, near the end of this regular season they are only a few games above .500.  Their current record is 42-38 as of today, which is only the 13th best record in the NBA out of 30 teams.

The reason for the drop is not clear.  The Warriors have the same starting lineup as last year with 4 All-Stars and when playing at Home their record is among the best in the league.  However, when playing on the road the Warriors have one of the worst records at 9-30.  A big factor in their road losses is lack of good defense, as opposing teams score considerably more points against the Warriors than when the Warriors play at home.  There seems to be a lack of focus and intensity from the Warriors players on defense in these away games and in the NBA, where the margin between winning and losing is very thin, that has seemed to make the difference."

What is a bond in finance?,"In finance, a bond is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged – depending on the terms – to provide cash flow to the creditor (e.g. repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date as well as interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time).The timing and the amount of cash flow provided varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon, thus giving rise to different types of bonds. The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.

Bonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind secured creditors, in the event of bankruptcy. Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, which is a perpetuity, that is, a bond with no maturity. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are classified as money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.

The most common forms include municipal, corporate, and government bonds. Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion-stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market. The price of a bond in the secondary market may differ substantially from the principal due to various factors in bond valuation."

In American Football, instead of using their feet, players use their hands to pass the ball to one another through the air or hand the ball off to one another and attempt to run into the opponent's endzone. When European Football eventually came to the United States, the moniker soccer remained with the sport.

What is a phenotype?,"In genetics and genomics, the phenotype  is the set of observable characteristics or traits of an organism. The term covers the organism's morphology (physical form and structure), its developmental processes, its biochemical and physiological properties, its behavior, and the products of behavior. An organism's phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism's genetic code (its genotype) and the influence of environmental factors. Both factors may interact, further affecting the phenotype. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called polymorphic. A well-documented example of polymorphism is Labrador Retriever coloring; while the coat color depends on many genes, it is clearly seen in the environment as yellow, black, and brown. Richard Dawkins in 1978 and then again in his 1982 book The Extended Phenotype suggested that one can regard bird nests and other built structures such as caddisfly larva cases and beaver dams as ""extended phenotypes"".

Wilhelm Johannsen proposed the genotype–phenotype distinction in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's hereditary material and what that hereditary material produces. The distinction resembles that proposed by August Weismann (1834–1914), who distinguished between germ plasm (heredity) and somatic cells (the body). More recently, in The Selfish Gene (1976), Dawkins distinguished these concepts as replicators and vehicles.

The genotype–phenotype distinction should not be confused with Francis Crick's central dogma of molecular biology, a statement about the directionality of molecular sequential information flowing from DNA to protein, and not the reverse."

SpellBee has become very popular with the events being telecast on TV. The event is becoming more popular among the Indian community in the US as they see Indian kids being successful in the contests and getting national recognition when they perform well in SpellBee. When the Indian parents find that their kids are showing some aptitude in spelling and are capable of putting in the required effort, the parents start motivating the children to start practising for SpellBee contests. 

These children of Indian origin spend significant effort over a period of several months or in some cases even years fine tuning their skills to practise for SpellBee contests. A combination of hard work, the support from the parents and family and the motivation of these children to perform well in SpellBee are all factors contributing to the success of the children of Indian origin in the SpellBee contests in the USA."

What is the difference between the Debt Snowball and Debt Avalanche methods of paying off debt?,"The Debt Snowball and Debt Avalanche are two widely known methods of paying off debt. One is a mathematically faster way to pay off the debt; whereas, the alternative is slightly slower but is more psychologically motivating. This motivation is what helps the person reach their debt pay off goals. The following set of debts will be used as the basis for explaining each method:

Debt A has a balance of $10,000 at a 4% interest rate. 
Debt B has a balance of $5,000 at a 10% interest rate.
Debt C has a balance of $8,000 at a 24% interest rate. 

The Debt Avalanche is typically the fastest and most cost effective way to pay off debt. The person makes minimum payments on all their debts and any extra goes towards the account with highest interest rate (Debt C in example above). Once that first balance is paid off, the person takes the payments from that and puts it all towards the second highest interest rate (Debt B). Repeat until all debts are paid.

The Debt Snowball is a method popularized by a personal finance expert, Dave Ramsey, in Step 2 of his 7 Baby Steps to building wealth. This method uses psychology by paying off the smallest balance first (Debt B above). The theory is that the feeling of quickly paying off a debt balance provides the motivation to stick with the program. Similar to the Debt Avalanche, the person takes the payments from Debt B and puts it towards the next smallest balance (Debt C). Repeat until all debts are paid."

What are all the different types of alpaca breeds?,"The alpaca comes in two breeds, Suri and Huacaya, based on their fibers rather than scientific or European classifications.

Huacaya alpacas are the most commonly found, constituting about 90% of the population. The Huacaya alpaca is thought to have originated in post-colonial Peru. This is due to their thicker fleece which makes them more suited to survive in the higher altitudes of the Andes after being pushed into the highlands of Peru with the arrival of the Spanish.

Suri alpacas represent a smaller portion of the total alpaca population, around 10%. They are thought to have been more prevalent in pre-Columbian Peru since they could be kept at a lower altitude where a thicker fleece was not needed for harsh weather conditions."

He has been widely considered the wealthiest American of all time and the richest person in modern history. Rockefeller was born into a large family in Upstate New York that moved several times before eventually settling in Cleveland. He became an assistant bookkeeper at age 16 and went into several business partnerships beginning at age 20, concentrating his business on oil refining. Rockefeller founded the Standard Oil Company in 1870. He ran it until 1897 and remained its largest shareholder.

Rockefeller's wealth soared as kerosene and gasoline grew in importance, and he became the richest person in the country, controlling 90% of all oil in the United States at his peak. Oil was used throughout the country as a light source until the introduction of electricity, and as a fuel after the invention of the automobile. Furthermore, Rockefeller gained enormous influence over the railroad industry which transported his oil around the country. Standard Oil was the first great business trust in the United States. Rockefeller revolutionized the petroleum industry and, through corporate and technological innovations, was instrumental in both widely disseminating and drastically reducing the production cost of oil. His company and business practices came under criticism, particularly in the writings of author Ida Tarbell."

Arsenal was the first club from the South of England to join the Football League in 1893, and they reached the First Division in 1904. Relegated only once, in 1913, they continue the longest streak in the top division, and have won the second-most top-flight matches in English football history. In the 1930s, Arsenal won five League Championships and two FA Cups, and another FA Cup and two Championships after the war. In 1970–71, they won their first League and FA Cup Double.

Between 1998 and 2017, Arsenal qualified for the UEFA Champions League for nineteen consecutive seasons.

Herbert Chapman, who changed the fortunes of Arsenal forever, won the club its first silverware, and his legacy led the club to dominate the 1930s decade; Chapman, however, died of pneumonia in 1934, aged 55. He helped introduce the WM formation, floodlights, and shirt numbers; he also added the white sleeves and brighter red to the club's jersey. Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager and won the most trophies. He won a record seven FA Cups, and his title-winning team set an English record for the longest top-flight unbeaten league run at 49 games between 2003 and 2004, receiving the nickname The Invincibles.

In 1886, munitions workers at the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich founded the club as Dial Square. In 1913 the club crossed the city to Arsenal Stadium in Highbury, becoming close neighbours of Tottenham Hotspur, and creating the North London derby. In 2006, they moved to the nearby Emirates Stadium. With an annual revenue of £340.3m in the 2019–20 season, Arsenal was estimated to be worth US$2.68 billion by Forbes, making it the world's eighth most valuable club, while it is one of the most followed on social media.The motto of the club has long been Victoria Concordia Crescit, Latin for ""Victory Through Harmony""."

What are the pros and cons of working from home rather than going into an office downtown?,"There are both advantages and disadvantages from working from home, and they apply differently to different people depending on the person's personality, family situation, location, and job description. Some key advantages are the ability to develop closer personal relationships with team members, have the opportunity for more spontaneous casual conversations, and experience more productive meetings because of the ability to read people's body language and to see presentation materials more clearly. Many people will experience better mental health by going into the office and establishing a sense of greater connection with team members. In addition, certain employees will take advantage of remote work to use work time to engage in personal activities rather than real work, to the detriment of the employer. Some disadvantages of going into the office include the time inefficiency from commuting, the cost of commuting, the time inefficiency that occurs from experiencing all the social chatting that occurs in the office, and the hassle of having to schedule conference rooms.

It is essentially the process of printing an image or artwork onto a surface by pushing ink through a screen. The screens are pulled tight and held in a metal or wood frame. Much like a picture frame. Depending on the detail of the artwork, the screens can have different size weave. The weave is essentially how tight the screen is woven and how large the holes in the screen are. For more detailed designs, the screen used will be woven very close and tight so the holes are very small and let less ink through. This allows for very thin lines and detail. Each screen can print 1 color at a time. So, to print a design with multiple colors, there needs to be multiple screens. 1 screen per color. Many screen printing presses have large rotating arms that hold the screens. The arms rotate for each color to be printed individually."

What are the drawbacks of nuclear fusion?,"List of Cons of Nuclear Fusion
1. It is extremely difficult to achieve. 
In stars, strong gravitational forces and high temperatures naturally create a fusion environment. But here on Earth, we are facing the challenge to make nuclear fuel hot and confined enough to start a self-sustaining ignition.

Imagine trying to contain the plasma (a gaseous mixture of deuterium, tritium atoms and ions, and helium the fusion product) at 100 million degrees celsius. No material can withstand that temperature. So, scientists attempt to keep the plasma (being electrically charged and having a magnetic field of its own) suspended in a magnetic field produced by superconducting magnets around the fusion chamber/vessel. This is similar to how bullet trains float on their tracks at ridiculous speeds. This process is very difficult to achieve (as compared to nuclear FISSION).

2. It produces radioactive waste.
Though nuclear power plants only emit negligible amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, its nuclear fuel chain process does produce radioactive waste.

The radioactive waste produced with fusion is not the same as with fission, and the two are often confused. With a nuclear fission reactor, the radiation is alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays (which can penetrate your skin and break apart the bonds in your DNA structure, giving you all kinds of cancer). In contrast, in a nuclear fusion reactor, the vessel wall is the only part that will be bombarded by the high energy neutrons, and if, in the worst case, all the protective layers surrounding the main fusion vessel fail, the neutron radiation will stop as soon as fusion reaction stops. In a fission reactor, the cancer-causing radiation still exists even in the waste materials, which means that extreme measures are needed to burry the waste to keep it as far away as possible from humans. In the case of nuclear fusion, the activated materials (i.e., the metal vessels which have been bombarded by neutrons) can be stored safely for about 100 years, after which the radiation level becomes so low that they can be reused in the fusion reactor again."

How do you throw a cutter in baseball?,"A cutter is a pitch in baseball with action and movement similar to a hybrid between a fastball and a slider.  Perhaps the most famous cutter pitcher in baseball history, a closer from the New York Yankees named, Mariano Rivera, used the cutter exclusively all the way to the hall of fame.  The cutter is thrown like a fastball, but with a ""football"" throwing arm action where the pitcher's palm faces their opposing arm as they release the pitch.  Grips for the cutter can vary, however, the keys are to hold the middle of the baseball, cross the seems at an angle similar to a slider and be sure not to turn or twist on release.  With this approach, the cutter is a pitch safe for youth baseball as young as age 9 and can be effective all the way to the World Series as demonstrated by Mariano Rivera."

It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century.

Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession. Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II. Devastating effects were seen in both rich and poor countries with falling personal income, prices, tax revenues, and profits. International trade fell by more than 50%, unemployment in the U.S. rose to 23% and in some countries rose as high as 33%."

What s epigenomics?,"Epigenomics is the study of the complete set of epigenetic modifications on the genetic material of a cell, known as the epigenome. The field is analogous to genomics and proteomics, which are the study of the genome and proteome of a cell. Epigenetic modifications are reversible modifications on a cell's DNA or histones that affect gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Epigenomic maintenance is a continuous process and plays an important role in stability of eukaryotic genomes by taking part in crucial biological mechanisms like DNA repair. Plant flavones are said to be inhibiting epigenomic marks that cause cancers. Two of the most characterized epigenetic modifications are DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic modifications play an important role in gene expression and regulation, and are involved in numerous cellular processes such as in differentiation/development and tumorigenesis. The study of epigenetics on a global level has been made possible only recently through the adaptation of genomic high-throughput assays."

Mutation in a pleiotropic gene may have an effect on several traits simultaneously, due to the gene coding for a product used by a myriad of cells or different targets that have the same signaling function.

Pleiotropy can arise from several distinct but potentially overlapping mechanisms, such as gene pleiotropy, developmental pleiotropy, and selectional pleiotropy. Gene pleiotropy occurs when a gene product interacts with multiple other proteins or catalyzes multiple reactions. Developmental pleiotropy occurs when mutations have multiple effects on the resulting phenotype. Selectional pleiotropy occurs when the resulting phenotype has many effects on fitness (depending on factors such as age and gender).

An example of pleiotropy is phenylketonuria, an inherited disorder that affects the level of phenylalanine, an amino acid that can be obtained from food, in the human body. Phenylketonuria causes this amino acid to increase in amount in the body, which can be very dangerous. The disease is caused by a defect in a single gene on chromosome 12 that codes for enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, that affects multiple systems, such as the nervous and integumentary system.

Pleiotropic gene action can limit the rate of multivariate evolution when natural selection, sexual selection or artificial selection on one trait favors one allele, while selection on other traits favors a different allele. Some gene evolution is harmful to an organism. Genetic correlations and responses to selection most often exemplify pleiotropy."

What is mass spectrometry?,"Mass spectrometry (MS) is an analytical technique that is used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. The results are presented as a mass spectrum, a plot of intensity as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. Mass spectrometry is used in many different fields and is applied to pure samples as well as complex mixtures.

A mass spectrum is a type of plot of the ion signal as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. These spectra are used to determine the elemental or isotopic signature of a sample, the masses of particles and of molecules, and to elucidate the chemical identity or structure of molecules and other chemical compounds.

In a typical MS procedure, a sample, which may be solid, liquid, or gaseous, is ionized, for example by bombarding it with a beam of electrons. This may cause some of the sample's molecules to break up into positively charged fragments or simply become positively charged without fragmenting. These ions (fragments) are then separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio, for example by accelerating them and subjecting them to an electric or magnetic field: ions of the same mass-to-charge ratio will undergo the same amount of deflection. The ions are detected by a mechanism capable of detecting charged particles, such as an electron multiplier. Results are displayed as spectra of the signal intensity of detected ions as a function of the mass-to-charge ratio. The atoms or molecules in the sample can be identified by correlating known masses (e.g. an entire molecule) to the identified masses or through a characteristic fragmentation pattern."

Ketosis is a metabolic state in which fat stores in the liver produce ketones to use as energy instead of glucose from carbohydrates. The idea here is to force the body to burn fat for energy instead of carbs, which contributes to weight loss and other healthy effects such as enhanced blood sugar and energy levels. It is worth noting that this diet requires a lifestyle that is often difficult to maintain and breaking it can lead to adverse effects. Some professionals advocate for moderation, balance and regular exercise rather than attempting to maintain ketosis."

What is reserve requirement?,"Reserve requirements are central bank regulations that set the minimum amount that a commercial bank must hold in liquid assets. This minimum amount, commonly referred to as the commercial bank's reserve, is generally determined by the central bank on the basis of a specified proportion of deposit liabilities of the bank. This rate is commonly referred to as the reserve ratio. Though the definitions vary, the commercial bank's reserves normally consist of cash held by the bank and stored physically in the bank vault (vault cash), plus the amount of the bank's balance in that bank's account with the central bank. A bank is at liberty to hold in reserve sums above this minimum requirement, commonly referred to as excess reserves.

The reserve ratio is sometimes used by a country’s monetary authority as a tool in monetary policy, to influence the country's money supply by limiting or expanding the amount of lending by the banks. Monetary authorities increase the reserve requirement only after careful consideration because an abrupt change may cause liquidity problems for banks with low excess reserves; they generally prefer to use open market operations (buying and selling government-issued bonds) to implement their monetary policy. In the United States and many other countries (except Brazil, China, India, Russia), reserve requirements are generally not altered frequently in implementing a country's monetary policy because of the short-term disruptive effect on financial markets."

What is the difference between AWD and 4WD?,"AWD is a system that without driver intervention, shifts power between the rear and front wheels. This system is typically found on light-duty SUVs or passenger cars. The AWD drive system is designed for mild inclement weather conditions such as light snow, ice and rain. It is not designed for off-roading or severe weather conditions such as heavy snow or mud. This is where the 4WD system comes into the picture. 

4WD is a system that includes a transfer case that directly applies power to the rear axle, both front and rear axles and in some cases, only to the front axle. In addition, some 4WD systems include lower gear ratio options, locking hubs and lockers in the axles that force an equal amount of power to each wheel. All this taken together enables a 4WD system to enable a vehicle to navigate through deep snow, mud, over rocks and other obstacles with ease. The 4WD system is most commonly found on trucks, Jeeps and other purpose-built vehicles designed for heavy-duty use, whether for work or pleasure."

Finally, you can utilize alternative car rental companies such as Turo if they are available in the region you are travelling to."
What is a genome-wide association study (GWAS)?,"In genomics, a genome-wide association study (GWA study, or GWAS), is an observational study of a genome-wide set of genetic variants in different individuals to see if any variant is associated with a trait. GWA studies typically focus on associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases, but can equally be applied to any other genetic variants and any other organisms.

When applied to human data, GWA studies compare the DNA of participants having varying phenotypes for a particular trait or disease. These participants may be people with a disease (cases) and similar people without the disease (controls), or they may be people with different phenotypes for a particular trait, for example blood pressure. This approach is known as phenotype-first, in which the participants are classified first by their clinical manifestation(s), as opposed to genotype-first. Each person gives a sample of DNA, from which millions of genetic variants are read using SNP arrays. If there is significant statistical evidence that one type of the variant (one allele) is more frequent in people with the disease, the variant is said to be associated with the disease. The associated SNPs are then considered to mark a region of the human genome that may influence the risk of disease.

GWA studies investigate the entire genome, in contrast to methods that specifically test a small number of pre-specified genetic regions. Hence, GWAS is a non-candidate-driven approach, in contrast to gene-specific candidate-driven studies. GWA studies identify SNPs and other variants in DNA associated with a disease, but they cannot on their own specify which genes are causal.

The first successful GWAS published in 2002 studied myocardial infarction. This study design was then implemented in the landmark GWA 2005 study investigating patients with age-related macular degeneration, and found two SNPs with significantly altered allele frequency compared to healthy controls. As of 2017, over 3,000 human GWA studies have examined over 1,800 diseases and traits, and thousands of SNP associations have been found. Except in the case of rare genetic diseases, these associations are very weak, but while they may not explain much of the risk, they provide insight into genes and pathways that can be important."
How is plastic made?,"Plastic is made from oil, natural gas and even plant oils during refining of these oils into other products like gasoline.  Ethane and propane are created when treated with heat during a refinery process called cracking.  This turns the Ethane and propane into ethylene and propylene which are used with other chemical ingredients to create polymers that are the base of what plastic is made out of."
What is the route to eternal happiness?,"Being at peace with oneself is the route to happiness.

What number octane gas should be used for combustion engines in vehicles?,"Manufacturers list the minimal octane to be used on specific vehicles in the owners manual. Always check the manual to be sure the proper fuel is being used. An octane number such as 87, 91, 93 indicates the amount of heat tolerance of the fuel before igniting inside the engine cylinder. The higher the octane number, the higher heat tolerance. If you use the wrong octane in a vehicle, such as using 87, rather than 93 for a high performing turbo or supercharged vehicle, the engine could produce knock or pre-detonation. Knock occurs when the timing of of the air and fuel mixture in the cylinder explodes too early and can cause serious damage to the engine components. Knock is also something you can hear and feel and can be noticed by the driver. Having the detonation of the air and fuel, produced by the spark plug that is intended from the factory is optimal for the longevity of the vehicle."

What are the pros and cons of charging your Tesla at home?,"The most convenient way to charge your EV is to charge it at home overnight while you sleep. Home chargers tend to be slow chargers which reach around 3.6 - 7 kW, although you can also charge using your home’s plug sockets which charge at speeds of around 2.3 kW. 

Pros
Charging your Tesla Model Y at home overnight is probably the cheapest, most cost-efficient way to charge your EV. This is because off-peak energy prices are significantly cheaper than peak charging. Model Ys come with an adapter wire, allowing you to charge your EV using your home's plugs easily. 

If you're interested in charging at home, installing a home charging unit could be worth your time. Over time this could save you money. There are grants available to help you afford a home charger. 

The OZEV Chargepoint Grant is up to £350 or 75% off the fully installed charge point cost if specifics are met. There is also the Scottish EST Domestic Chargepoint Grant which gives you up to £300 and can be used alongside the OZEV Chargepoint Grant.

Cons
Home chargers rarely exceed speeds of 7 kW. This means charging the Tesla Model Y's large battery would take a long time. If you don't invest in a home charging station, it might also be risky to home charge as the 3-pin plug can damage your home's wiring. 

If you choose to charge during the day, it can also get quite expensive and may not compare favourably with public charging stations, despite being much slower."

What is 'karma' according to Buddhism?,"Karma is a central and fundamental aspect of Buddhist doctrine common to all traditions of Buddhism. The Buddhist concept of Karma is a natural process that operates with all our volitional actions and which does not need an external agency or power that sits in judgement.

Karma in Buddhism should not be considered as moral justice, or a method of reward and punishment, that needs an external body or authority to decide whom or what should be punished and rewarded. It is believed that Gautama Buddha attained complete insight into how the process of Karma works during the night of his full enlightenment when, through the divine eye (dibbacakku), Buddha saw how other beings die and are reborn in happy and unhappy states according to their Karma.

According to the Cula-kammavibhanga sutta of the Majima Nikava (collection of the middle length discourses of the Buddha), a young brahmin by the name of Subha had approached the Buddha and inquired as to why there was so much inequality among human beings in terms of being short-lived or long-lived, sickly or healthy, ugly or beautiful, powerful or powerless, poor or rich, low-born or high-born, ignorant or intelligent, etc. Buddha had then explained that:
""all living beings are the owners of their actions, heirs to their actions, they originate from their actions, they are related through their actions, they have their actions as their refuge and that it is action or Karma that distinguishes beings as inferior and superior

The word Karma in Pali, and karma in Sanskrit, means action but encompasses only actions that are intentional, volitional and willful and which will lead to consequences sooner or later. The mind (citta) by itself cannot perform or direct any mental, verbal or physical action and it is the intention, will, mental effort or volition (cetana) that directs any mental, verbal or physical action.

Thus the Buddha declared:
""Cetanaham bhikkhave kammam vadami
Cetayitva kammam karoti, kayena, vacaya, manasa""

""It is volition that I call Karma, by volition one performs Karma through body, word or mind."""
Give me a summary about St Paul's Cathedral,"St Paul's Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in London and is the seat of the Bishop of London. The cathedral serves as the mother church of the Diocese of London. It is on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is a Grade I listed building. Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present structure, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the city after the Great Fire of London. The earlier Gothic cathedral (Old St Paul's Cathedral), largely destroyed in the Great Fire, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St Paul's Churchyard, being the site of St Paul's Cross.

The cathedral is one of the most famous and recognisable sights of London. Its dome, surrounded by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At 365 ft (111 m) high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1963. The dome is still one of the highest in the world. St Paul's is the second-largest church building in area in the United Kingdom, after Liverpool Cathedral."

What is palmitoylation,"Palmitoylation is the covalent attachment of fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, to cysteine (S-palmitoylation) and less frequently to serine and threonine (O-palmitoylation) residues of proteins, which are typically membrane proteins. The precise function of palmitoylation depends on the particular protein being considered. Palmitoylation enhances the hydrophobicity of proteins and contributes to their membrane association. Palmitoylation also appears to play a significant role in subcellular trafficking of proteins between membrane compartments, as well as in modulating protein–protein interactions. In contrast to prenylation and myristoylation, palmitoylation is usually reversible (because the bond between palmitic acid and protein is often a thioester bond). The reverse reaction in mammalian cells is catalyzed by acyl-protein thioesterases (APTs) in the cytosol and palmitoyl protein thioesterases in lysosomes. Because palmitoylation is a dynamic, post-translational process, it is believed to be employed by the cell to alter the subcellular localization, protein–protein interactions, or binding capacities of a protein.

An example of a protein that undergoes palmitoylation is hemagglutinin, a membrane glycoprotein used by influenza to attach to host cell receptors. The palmitoylation cycles of a wide array of enzymes have been characterized in the past few years, including H-Ras, Gsα, the β2-adrenergic receptor, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In signal transduction via G protein, palmitoylation of the α subunit, prenylation of the γ subunit, and myristoylation is involved in tethering the G protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane so that the G protein can interact with its receptor."

What is comparative genomics?,"The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between genes (orthology analysis) or other genomic features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion. Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and endosymbiosis, often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectrum of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, heuristics, fixed parameter and approximation algorithms for problems based on parsimony models to Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for Bayesian analysis of problems based on probabilistic models.

Many of these studies are based on the detection of sequence homology to assign sequences to protein families."

Is the Vex or FIRST robotics competition a better choice for a child in high school?,"Both VEX and FIRST have very strong robotics competitions for the high school level.  If you are a parent choosing between the two, multiple factors need to be taken into consideration.
The first factor is the availability of a robotics program in your area.  While you can form an independent team that is not affiliated with your school or another organization, it will require a significant financial and time investment.  At the high school level teams typically design their robots with CAD software and must machine the parts themselves.  Teams often consist of 20 or more members so that all of the aspects of the competition can be covered, such as creating and assembling the hardware, electrical wiring, systems design, programming and documenting the engineering process.  All of the parts and equipment need to be purchased and maintained, and members put in a lot of hours during the competition season.  Joining a pre-existing team that already has equipment, members and mentors familiar with a program will make it easiest for a child to participate, regardless of which competition the team is a part of.
If both VEX and FIRST programs are available, then it depends on how intense of an experience the child is interested in.  The VEX competition has a lower barrier to entry because it requires smaller robots.  Two pairs of robots compete against each other in a match to see which pair can get more points.  While teams will need to machine some parts and must have skills in electrical and software design, a team can be smaller and still compete effectively.  The FIRST competition involves much larger and more complex robots and challenges.  Two alliances of three robots each compete against each other in a match, with a total of six robots on the field at once.  Teams need to have more members to effectively compete, and participants need more in-depth training on hardware, electrical, system and software design.  There is also a business requirement, where teams have to create a marketing banner, brochure and video for their team to submit as part of the competition.
Whether you choose VEX or FIRST, a child in high school that participates in a well-run robotics program will gain valuable engineering and organizational experience that will serve them well, both on a college application and after graduation."

How did Caesar come to power in Rome?,"Gaius Julius Caesar was a Roman general and statesman born around 100 B.C. He was born in a patrician family (senatorial class) called the Julii that claimed lineage from the Goddess Venus and the legendary Prince Aeneas of Troy. His birth in this family had already put him ahead of most others on the road to power.

Caesar was smart, hard working and charming and made many friends and connections that would help him later in life. He married a relative of Gaius Marius, the dictator of Rome at the time and furthered his political connections. Though he suffered a setback when Sulla defeated Marius, Caesar was quickly able to use that to his advantage to escape a posting that required him to remain in Rome. It was important for any aspiring Consul (leader of Rome) to be seen as an effective military general who had conquered lands for Rome.

Caesar's next significant position was that of Aedile where one of his primary duties were to organize games. Caesar borrowed heavily and organized lavish games so that the people of Rome would know him. Unlike other patricians, Caesar had grown up in the Subura where, at the time, the plebeians lived and knew the importance and power that could be garnered from the love of the people.

Through multiple appointments, Caesar displayed his military genius and was eventually elected Consul. He formed an alliance with two other leading figures of the time: Pompey (a decorated general) and Crassus (richest man in Rome) known now as the ""First Triumvirate"". 

After his consulship, Caesar become Governor of Gaul and eventually won a lot of territory for Rome. However, his political opponents in Rome readied a case for prosecuting him and stripping of power. Unwilling to be subject to that, Caesar gathered one of his legions and marched on Rome. His political opponents performed a tactical retreat from Rome leaving him in nominal control. He consolidated his power by winning multiple wars in Greece, Spain and Egypt eventually solidifying his hold on Rome and getting himself elected Dictator"

Batters also must be in the batter's box and ready to hit with at least 8 seconds remaining on the clock. If a pitcher fails to deliver the pitch within the allotted time, the batter is awarded an automatic ball. If the batter is not ready to hit within 8 seconds, the batter receives an automatic strike."

We have had dogs that live indoors with the family and outdoors in their own doghouse.  We have raised puppies from our dogs and given them away to friends and neighbors.  Dogs provide a lot of love and companionship to everyone in the family and they can be as beloved as any human.  Dogs take a great deal to care for because they are completely dependent on humans to keep them alive.  A dog left out in the wild is unlikely to survive without help from a caring human.  Dogs must be fed, watered, walked for exercise, socialized with other dogs and with other people as well so that they feel safe and interact safely with others.  Dogs can live to between 10 and 15 years old on average so they are with a family for a long time.  Dogs come in all shapes, sizes, colors, skills and are often referred to as breeds.  Breeds have different characteristics and people sometimes select a dog for the breed.  Sometimes dogs are neglected or left without a family to care for them and end up in temporary homes called animal shelters.  These shelters provide a safe haven for a dog until a suitable owner is matched.  Many of the best dogs that a family gets come from a shelter."

What is Java?,"Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers."

Eventually they started adding gears to the bikes so that they could pedal them up the hill as well.  The most famous trail was named Repack, because often after the races riders would have to re-pack the coaster brakes with grease because the grease would vaporize from the heat from the hard braking as they raced down the hill.  Modern bike brands like Fisher, Ritchey, Klein, Breezer, and Specialized all had their start in the Marin County foothills north of San Francisco, in the small town of Fairfax."

What is a stock in finance?,"In finance, stock (also capital stock) consist of all the shares by which ownership of a corporation or company is divided. (Especially in American English, the word ""stocks"" is also used to refer to shares.) A single share of the stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares. This typically entitles the shareholder (stockholder) to that fraction of the company's earnings, proceeds from liquidation of assets (after discharge of all senior claims such as secured and unsecured debt), or voting power, often dividing these up in proportion to the amount of money each stockholder has invested. Not all stock is necessarily equal, as certain classes of stock may be issued for example without voting rights, with enhanced voting rights, or with a certain priority to receive profits or liquidation proceeds before or after other classes of shareholders.

Stock can be bought and sold privately or on stock exchanges, and such transactions are typically heavily regulated by governments to prevent fraud, protect investors, and benefit the larger economy. The stocks are deposited with the depositories in the electronic format also known as Demat account. As new shares are issued by a company, the ownership and rights of existing shareholders are diluted in return for cash to sustain or grow the business. Companies can also buy back stock, which often lets investors recoup the initial investment plus capital gains from subsequent rises in stock price. Stock options issued by many companies as part of employee compensation do not represent ownership, but represent the right to buy ownership at a future time at a specified price. This would represent a windfall to the employees if the option is exercised when the market price is higher than the promised price, since if they immediately sold the stock they would keep the difference (minus taxes)."

Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, in particular when the data sets are large and complex. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret the biological data. Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using computational and statistical techniques.

Bioinformatics includes biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as specific analysis ""pipelines"" that are repeatedly used, particularly in the field of genomics. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidates genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Often, such identification is made with the aim to better understand the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organizational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences, called proteomics.

Image and signal processing allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed mutations. It plays a role in the text mining of biological literature and the development of biological and gene ontologies to organize and query biological data. It also plays a role in the analysis of gene and protein expression and regulation. Bioinformatics tools aid in comparing, analyzing and interpreting genetic and genomic data and more generally in the understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. At a more integrative level, it helps analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and networks that are an important part of systems biology. In structural biology, it aids in the simulation and modeling of DNA, RNA, proteins as well as biomolecular interactions."

Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow."" In Churchill's mind, the ""iron curtain"" defines the boundary which separates western European countries under US influence and eastern European countries under Soviet Control. This was further solidified by the creation of the Berlin wall and the Soviet supported Communist governments that ruled over eastern European countries throughout the cold war. After the collapse of Soviet Union, the iron curtain disappeared as many eastern European countries topped their Communist governments and joined the Western sphere of influence."

What are ways to improve running speed?,"There are several training methods to increase your race speed, they all play with tempo in different forms.
Interval training is one way to increase running speed. In this form of training, you alternate between slow and fast tempos within a training session.

A marathon runner goes through a different interval training as a 800 meter runner.
Another way to train and increase the running speed are tempo runs. Here you run at a higher pace than the actual target pace. The intensity of the load is correspondingly high, the duration of the load and the distance is therefore shorter.
Overall, however, it is important to remember that base training is just as important for increasing race speed as fast tempo sessions. With long runs, the appropriate foundations are laid in order to build them up with the previously mentioned speed units."

Use a campfire ring, pit, or clear a large area around your campfire location. Also, make sure campfires are permitted in your area. 

With safety out of the way, all a fire needs are heat, fuel, and oxygen. Any combustible material will start a fire, but good campfire fuel sources include tinder, kindling, and dry logs.

Use stuff like dry pine needles, dry leaves, grasses, and wood shavings for tinder. You could also use newspaper (or any paper), dryer lint, or cardboard. For kindling, use smaller pieces of wood, such as twigs and sticks no thicker than 1 inch in diameter (about the thickness of your thumb). Dry or well-seasoned logs will ensure a good burn. Stack the wood in a way that guarantees oxygen can easily reach your flame. Many prefer a teepee or log cabin stacking design. Now, use a heat source to create a flame or spark and apply this to your tinder. Once the tinder combusts, it should light the kindling, and the kindling should eventually ignite your logs. If all goes well, you should now be enjoying your campfire."

Do you know that there is a spectator within your mind more like a dual personality? it is the subject - object thing. The spectator within you is the observer of things and is often neutral.

Idea of meditation is to remain a spectator for long periods of time and let fewer and fewer thoughts arise into your conscious state. At the end it leaves you a with a sense of accomplishment because as a spectator you're waiting and this deliberate attempt makes the thought (referred as devil) disappear."

Why is cold water coming out of my water heater?,"If your gas water heater is not working, first check to see if:

 - Is the water heater leaking? If so, turn off the water and gas to the heater, and contact a plumber to replace the heater.
 - Do you smell gas around your heater? If so, you likely have a gas leak--turn off the gas line to the heater and contact a plumber to replace the heater.
 
If neither of these are issues, check to see if the pilot light for you heater is lit. This is likely hidden behind a panel or door on the bottom of the front of the heater.  If the pilot light is not lit, follow the instructions to try re-lighting it.

If the pilot light does not light or continues to go out after heating the water, the thermal coupling on the water heater likely needs to be replaced. Contact a plumber to have this replaced.

Generally speaking, traditional tank-based, gas water heaters have a lifetime of 10-15 years. If the age water heater is within this range, you may want to prepare for replacing the water heater soon."

Seasons typically run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all other teams both home and away).

The Premier League is a corporation where chief executive Richard Masters is responsible for its management, whilst the member clubs act as shareholders. Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to English Football League (EFL) clubs.

The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people. For the 2018–19 season, the average Premier League match attendance was at 38,181, second to the German Bundesliga's 43,500, while aggregated attendance across all matches is the highest of any association football league at 14,508,981. Most stadium occupancies are near capacity. The Premier League ranks first in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons as of 2021. The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of UEFA Champions League/European Cup titles, with five English clubs having won fourteen European trophies in total.

Fifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (6), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1) and Liverpool (1)."
What is Spatial Analysis?,"Spatial analysis is any of the formal techniques which studies entities using their topological, geometric, or geographic properties. Spatial analysis includes a variety of techniques using different analytic approaches, especially spatial statistics. In may be applied in fields as diverse as astronomy, with its studies of the placement of galaxies in the cosmos, or to chip fabrication engineering, with its use of ""place and route"" algorithms to build complex wiring structures. In a more restricted sense, spatial analysis is geospatial analysis, the technique applied to structures at the human scale, most notably in the analysis of geographic data. It may also be applied to genomics, as in transcriptomics data.

Complex issues arise in spatial analysis, many of which are neither clearly defined nor completely resolved, but form the basis for current research. The most fundamental of these is the problem of defining the spatial location of the entities being studied. Classification of the techniques of spatial analysis is difficult because of the large number of different fields of research involved, the different fundamental approaches which can be chosen, and the many forms the data can take."

Tell me about cockney rhyming slang,"Cockney rhyming slang is most closely associated with East London in England. It dates back to the 19th century. 

It works like this:

A word or phrase is replaced by another word or phrase that rhymes with it. For example instead of saying the word ""face"" you would say ""boat race"". The rhyming phrase is often longer than the original word and so the rhyme gets abbreviated. In our example ""boat race"" becomes ""boat"". 

So a sentence might become ""you should have seen the look on their boat"" instead of ""you should have seen the look on their face"". 

Another example might be ""I'm off up the apple and pears to go to me Uncle Ned"" - ""I'm going upstairs to go to bed""."

Why do firms advertise? Even when goods are interchangeable?,"Many firms advertise their goods or services, but are they wasting economic resources?
Some economists reckon that advertising merely manipulates consumer tastes and
creates desires that would not otherwise exist. By increasing product differentiation and
encouraging brand loyalty advertising may make consumers less price sensitive,
moving the market further from perfect competition towards imperfect competition
(see monopolistic competition) and increasing the ability of firms to charge more than
marginal cost. Heavy spending on advertising may also create a barrier to entry, as a
firm entering the market would have to spend a lot on advertising too."

What is the difference between retinol and tretinoin?,"Everyone’s skin is different, but no one’s skin is immune to the effects of sunlight, stress, and natural aging. To treat these effects, you might decide to use retinoids.

Retinoids are chemical compounds related to vitamin A.

Retinol and tretinoin are both examples of retinoids. Tretinoin can also be called all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA).

When it comes to treating your skin, the biggest difference between these two compounds is their strength.

Retinol is a vital nutrient. It’s fat-soluble, which means it can stay in your body for a long time. Your liver can take this stored retinol and convert it into tretinoin. Your body will use the tretinoin for a variety of biological functions.

For the purposes of skin care, tretinoin can be thought of as a more concentrated version of retinol. This means that tretinoin is stronger than retinol."
What is the successor liability and can you give me some practical examples about it,"In law, successor liability is liability (debt or other obligation) that is inherited by a successor entity after a corporate restructuring. Here, ‘successor’ refers to the entity that exists after the restructuring. ‘Restructuring’ refers to any action that alters the identity or character of a business entity (e.g. a merger). Successor liability is a subset of the law governing corporate liability or liability of legal persons.

A legal person is any person that can do the things a human person is able to do in law – such as enter into contracts, sue and be sued, own property, and so on. Depending on the jurisdiction, entities such as corporations, other types of firm, partnerships and state-owned enterprises may be treated as legal persons, with both rights and responsibilities under law. Successor liability rules influence how these rights and responsibilities vis-a-vis others are influenced by corporate restructurings.

Under corporate law (or possibly other bodies of law, such as employment or environmental law), some countries regulate how liability passes from a ‘predecessor’ entity to a 'successor' entity in the event of such corporate restructurings as a name change, merger or acquisition, division or dissolution. Following such restructurings, successor liability rules determine whether and how the 'successor' or acquiring entity must assume some or all of the predecessor entity's liabilities. Product liability, environmental clean-up, employment law and criminal law are some of the areas in which successor liability may enter into play. Thus, it is an important component of the legal system that supports the structural change needed in dynamic business sectors while also protecting individual and societal interests.

While a restructuring does not automatically give rise to successor liability, the following situations are often considered to be relevant when determining whether or not such liability exists: there is an explicit agreement between the parties on the assumption of some liabilities; the restructuring is considered to be a de facto merger; the restructuring results in the mere continuation of the predecessor’s business; and the transaction underpinning the restructuring was fraudulent and used to escape liability.

Without successor liability, a business entity may avoid liability by reorganising itself or otherwise altering its corporate identity. A comparative law study of successor liability in the context of enforcement of laws criminalising foreign bribery shows that countries have adopted widely different approaches to successor liability in a criminal law context. In some jurisdictions, it is not clear whether successor liability exists at all, opening up the possibility that even minor business reorganisations could 'wipe the slate clean' from the standpoint of criminal law enforcement. Other countries have comprehensive statutory frameworks that address successor liability. Still others rely on established jurisprudence or other legal principles as the legal foundation for successor liability."

What are the primary causes of inflation?,"In economics, inflation is the growth rate of the price of goods and services for a particular selection of items. For example, items that a typical household consumes are captured in the Consumer Price Index, whereas items that domestic producers buy are included in the Producer Price Index. The drivers behind changes in the general price levels can be attributed to two main reasons. First, changes in the real demand and supply of goods and services will drive prices up or down. Higher prices will encourage suppliers to increase supply and discourage consumer demand reestablishing market equilibrium. Second, changes in the money supply –i.e. the amount of currency in circulation, bank deposits, and other liquid monetary aggregates– can lead to inflation. When a country's central bank decides to increase the money supply through quantitative easing monetary policies, the amount of currency available to buy and sell the same amount of goods and services increases. If the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy remains unchanged (i.e. velocity of money is constant) then a higher money supply will lead to higher prices because there is more money to transact the same amount of goods and services in the economy."

Are fresh vegetable brought at a grocery store fresher than frozen vegetables?,"It's quite common for a lot of people to assume that fresh vegetables are fresher than frozen vegetables. In fact, many wrongly assume that freezing destroys nutrients. Nothing could be farther from the truth. To survive transportation and storage, fresh vegetables are often harvested prematurely at sub-par nutrition levels. On the other hand, frozen vegetables are harvested close to peak maturity and nutrition levels.

Unless you have your own kitchen garden or have access to a farmers market located close to where the vegetables are actually grown, frozen is a better bet - it's fresher, more convenient and rather crucially, more easily accessible for you to improve the health quotient of your meals. It's better to eat frozen peas all through the year than be puritanical about enjoying it only during winter. Eating healthily is as much a behavior science problem as it is a nutrition science problem, and it's easier to keep frozen peas around and eat it regularly than to try and remember what is currently in season and go out of the way to procure them fresh all the time. Long term convenience always trumps short term will power improvements."

What kind of method is Transfer printing,"Transfer printing is a method of decorating pottery or other materials using an engraved copper or steel plate from which a monochrome print on paper is taken which is then transferred by pressing onto the ceramic piece. Pottery decorated using the technique is known as transferware or transfer ware.

It was developed in England from the 1750s on, and in the 19th century became enormously popular in England, though relatively little used in other major pottery-producing countries. The bulk of production was from the dominant Staffordshire pottery industry. America was a major market for English transfer-printed wares, whose imagery was adapted to the American market; several makers made this almost exclusively.

The technique was essential for adding complex decoration such as the Willow pattern to relatively cheap pottery. In particular, transfer printing brought the price of a matching dinner service low enough for large numbers of people to afford.

Apart from pottery, the technique was used on metal, and enamelled metal, and sometimes on wood and textiles. It remains used today, although mostly superseded by lithography. In the 19th century methods of transfer printing in colour were developed."

What is an Oxford comma and why do editors have such strong feelings about their use?,"An Oxford comma is a comma before the last item in a series or list. For example take the following two statements:

I was chased by the fox, the bear and the dog.
I was chased by the fox, the bear, and the dog.

The meaning is the same but the second statement contains an Oxford comma.

Some say the Oxford comma adds clarity to some statements. This is apparent when there can be ambiguity between a list and an appositive. Take the following two example statements:

We went to dinner with our coaches, Chris and Terry.
We went to dinner with our coaches, Chris, and Terry.

The first statement can appear to imply that we went to dinner with two people whose names are Chris and Terry who are both our coaches. There is no such implication that can be extracted from the second statement. The second statement implies we went to dinner with at least 4 people: Chris, Terry, and at least two coaches. This type of ambiguity is what proponents of the Oxford comma latch onto in its defense.

On the other hand, opponents of the Oxford comma claim it should be avoided in favor of rewording sentences when necessary. The sentence:

We went to dinner with our coaches, Chris, and Terry.

Can easily be reworded as:

We went to dinner with Chris and Terry, as well as our coaches.

The ""as well as"" language is claimed to be more clear than the Oxford comma albeit less concise. Editors who oppose the Oxford comma typically privilege clarity over conciseness."

Because of this inherent diversity, each deafblind individual's needs regarding lifestyle, communication, education, and work need to be addressed based on their degree of dual-modality deprivation, to improve their ability to live independently.

The deafblind community has its own culture, comparable to those of the deaf community and the blind community.

Can you paint watercolor styled painting with acrylics?,"Yes, you can! The idea is to dilute your paint as much as possible to get the water transparency of watercolor. The process might take a bit of challenge as the opacity of acrylic paint is very thick, but with time and experience, it is possible.

2. data lakehouse combines the advantage of the data lake and data warehouse. the reliable transactions of a data warehouse and the scalability and low cost of a data lake. Single Source of Truth. Unified data from all sources
3. The data lake table format is the most important component of a lakehouse architecture. There must be some way to organize and manage all the raw data files in the data lake storage. Table formats help abstract the physical data structure’s complexity and allow different engines to work simultaneously on the same data. The table format in a lakehouse architecture facilitates the ability to do data warehouse-level transactions (DML) along with ACID guarantees. Some of the other critical features of a table format are schema evolution, expressive SQL, time travel, data compaction (ie Delta Lake). Apache Spark can also be used as the query engine"

What are the key steps for building a an in ground pool?,"Pre-construction site meeting - Before starting the construction of your pool, schedule a pre-construction site meeting. With a design consultant present, a site supervisor will review the plans and inspect your yard to ensure no modifications to the design are required. 

Excavation - The hole is dug and excess dirt is removed or dropped. The hole will be slightly larger and deeper than the finished pool, as the pool wall and bottom will take up some of this area.

Form & Steel - Now that the pool has been dug, the hole is with reinforced with “steel rebar” to add the strength required for your pool.

City Inspections - After installing the steel rebar, an inspector will review your pool plans and inspect the job site to make sure everything is up to code. 

Gunite - Crews will spray / apply the concrete that makes up your pool’s shell and steps. If your pool design includes any swim-outs, fountains, or a gunite spa, those elements will be part of this phase as well.

Backfill & grade - Once the gunite is dried, it’s time to start backfilling around the walls and braces. The material from excavation is used to fill in the space between the newly constructed shell of the pool and the rest of the backyard.

Plumbing Installation & Inspection - Plumbing crews begin installation, and dig trenches to lay pipe from your pool to the pool equipment. Any pipes for water features such as sprays, fountains, or rock falls will be installed, along with pool return lines and skimmer(s). After the plumbing installation, the city will inspect the work completed.

Site Grade - Prior to placing the decking, the construction crew will level out and compact the sub-base preparing for the patio.

Tile & Coping Installation - Tile crews will install your pool’s waterline tile and coping. Additional work may also be performed during this phase by a different set of crews if rock is used in your pool’s design. If your pool design requires a retaining wall at the edge of any part of your deck, it will be constructed at this time. 

Deck Installation - Crews will form the shape and sand your deck and any planter areas. After this process is complete chosen rock or tile finish is applied. 

Electrical - Pre-Electrical Equipment Hook Up: Installing your pool pump, filter, and gas heater (if applicable). Run the conduit for the main electric supply used by your pool equipment. They will also install lighting and any wiring necessary for your pool. City inspection at this time as well.

Screening - If you opted in for a screen, footers are poured and screen is constructed.
Pool Plaster - Prepare the concrete surface of your swimming pool, and then apply your pool’s finish and fill the pool with water – finishes cured underwater.  The water will need to stay on once it is started, without interruption, until your pool is full. Your pool will be considered completely full once the water reaches halfway up the tile line (middle of your waterline tile).

Clean up & inspection - During this phase, remove any trash that was created during the construction of your pool, and also complete the final grade of your yard. In most communities, an inspector from your city will inspect your pool area to ensure it is safe to use and everything has been properly completed.

Pool School - When the pool is balanced a Service Department will contact you to schedule an orientation. This orientation will answer any questions you may have about your new pool, as well as show you how to properly use your pool equipment.

A National Historic Landmark, the park is a day use facility offering hiking, hunting, picnicking and wildlife viewing. It is located 11 miles (18 km) south of Kirby, Montana on Montana Highway 314."
What is genome analysis?,"The genome sequence of an organism includes the collective DNA sequences of each chromosome in the organism. For a bacterium containing a single chromosome, a genome project will aim to map the sequence of that chromosome. For the human species, whose genome includes 22 pairs of autosomes and 2 sex chromosomes, a complete genome sequence will involve 46 separate chromosome sequences.

The Human Genome Project is a well known example of a genome project.

Genome assembly refers to the process of taking a large number of short DNA sequences and reassembling them to create a representation of the original chromosomes from which the DNA originated. In a shotgun sequencing project, all the DNA from a source (usually a single organism, anything from a bacterium to a mammal) is first fractured into millions of small pieces. These pieces are then ""read"" by automated sequencing machines. A genome assembly algorithm works by taking all the pieces and aligning them to one another, and detecting all places where two of the short sequences, or reads, overlap. These overlapping reads can be merged, and the process continues.

Genome assembly is a very difficult computational problem, made more difficult because many genomes contain large numbers of identical sequences, known as repeats. These repeats can be thousands of nucleotides long, and occur different locations, especially in the large genomes of plants and animals.

The resulting (draft) genome sequence is produced by combining the information sequenced contigs and then employing linking information to create scaffolds. Scaffolds are positioned along the physical map of the chromosomes creating a ""golden path"".

Originally, most large-scale DNA sequencing centers developed their own software for assembling the sequences that they produced. However, this has changed as the software has grown more complex and as the number of sequencing centers has increased. An example of such assembler Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package developed by BGI for de novo assembly of human-sized genomes, alignment, SNP detection, resequencing, indel finding, and structural variation analysis.

Since the 1980s, molecular biology and bioinformatics have created the need for DNA annotation. DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying attaching biological information to sequences , and particularly in identifying the locations of genes and determining what those genes do.

When sequencing a genome, there are usually regions that are difficult to sequence (often regions with highly repetitive DNA). Thus, 'completed' genome sequences are rarely ever complete, and terms such as 'working draft' or 'essentially complete' have been used to more accurately describe the status of such genome projects. Even when every base pair of a genome sequence has been determined, there are still likely to be errors present because DNA sequencing is not a completely accurate process. It could also be argued that a complete genome project should include the sequences of mitochondria and (for plants) chloroplasts as these organelles have their own genomes.

It is often reported that the goal of sequencing a genome is to obtain information about the complete set of genes in that particular genome sequence. The proportion of a genome that encodes for genes may be very small (particularly in eukaryotes such as humans, where coding DNA may only account for a few percent of the entire sequence). However, it is not always possible (or desirable) to only sequence the coding regions separately. Also, as scientists understand more about the role of this noncoding DNA (often referred to as junk DNA), it will become more important to have a complete genome sequence as a background to understanding the genetics and biology of any given organism.

In many ways genome projects do not confine themselves to only determining a DNA sequence of an organism. Such projects may also include gene prediction to find out where the genes are in a genome, and what those genes do. There may also be related projects to sequence ESTs or mRNAs to help find out where the genes actually are."

What is an ATM?,"An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic telecommunications device that enables customers of financial institutions to perform financial transactions, such as cash withdrawals, deposits, funds transfers, balance inquiries or account information inquiries, at any time and without the need for direct interaction with bank staff.

ATMs are known by a variety of names, including automatic teller machine (ATM) in the United States (sometimes redundantly as ""ATM machine""). In Canada, the term automated banking machine (ABM) is also used, although ATM is also very commonly used in Canada, with many Canadian organizations using ATM over ABM. In British English, the terms cashpoint, cash machine and hole in the wall are most widely used. Other terms include any time money, cashline, tyme machine, cash dispenser, cash corner, bankomat, or bancomat. ATMs that are not operated by a financial institution are known as ""white-label"" ATMs.

Using an ATM, customers can access their bank deposit or credit accounts in order to make a variety of financial transactions, most notably cash withdrawals and balance checking, as well as transferring credit to and from mobile phones. ATMs can also be used to withdraw cash in a foreign country. If the currency being withdrawn from the ATM is different from that in which the bank account is denominated, the money will be converted at the financial institution's exchange rate. Customers are typically identified by inserting a plastic ATM card (or some other acceptable payment card) into the ATM, with authentication being by the customer entering a personal identification number (PIN), which must match the PIN stored in the chip on the card (if the card is so equipped), or in the issuing financial institution's database."

"What is Emotional Quotient (EQ)/Emotional Intelligence, and why is it a critical trait for leaders to possess?","Emotional Quotient (EQ), also referred to as Emotional Intelligence, has been defined to mean the levels of self awareness, self management, social awareness, and relationship management, that an individual has.  High levels of all of these 4 EQ traits are important qualities for a effective managers. Essentially, someone with high EQ is very aware of how they are perceived, but just as importantly, they have an innate ability to discern others' feelings and motivations. Leaders with high EQ are interested in learning about what makes their employees tick, and they are aware that many people have completely different motivations. For example, a manager with high EQ understands that even though they may not personally be motivated primarily by receiving positive feedback, that if someone on their team becomes extremely motivated by praise for a job well done, they must make sure they are regularly delivering the kudos that employee thrives on.  In the past, there was a lot of focus on IQ, and while that can be a quality of a good manager, it is often more of the 'intangibles' of EQ and other personality traits that define an inspirational leader."
What's the difference between splitboarding and snowboarding?,"Splitboarding is a more specialized form of snowboarding that also enables uphill and lateral travel, in addition to conventional downhill (alpine) travel. Snowboarders will typically ride within a developed ski resort using powered chairlifts, while a splitboarder typically ventures into undeveloped areas backcountry areas.

From an equipment perspective, a splitboard looks like a conventional snowboard for downhill travel, but for uphill travel it splits into two ski-like surfaces that, with grippy climbing skins attached on the base that contacts the snow, enables people to step and glide uphill on snow.

In addition to conventional downhill snowboarding skills, splitboarding requires additional skills in uphill technique, safely navigating the backcountry (including avalanche risk)."

Why is my electrical outlet not working?,"Assuming that outlet has been working fine and there were not recent catastrophic events or construction that has taken place, you likely need to reset the circuit.

First check to see if there is an ongoing regional power outage. An easy way to check for this is to see if the power is working elsewhere in your building or neighboring buildings.

If the outage is localized to a portion of your building, you may want to check the following:

If the outlet is a GFCI, you will need to find the main outlet in the circuit and push the reset button on it.  GFCI (or GFI) outlets are common in locations where water is present, for example in kitchens and bathrooms.

If the outlet is not a GFCI outlet or if resetting the GFCI outlet had no effect, locate the circuit breaker for your building and check if any of the circuits have been tripped.  You can identify a tripped circuit when you open the panel by looking for the one of the circuits in the panel that is not in the same orientation as the others. Fix it by flipping the switch to match the others."

What are the different recurring costs associated with homeownership apart from mortgage?,"Apart from mortgage, first-time home owners will need to consider a variety of different costs that may catch them by surprise. Some of those are:
- Home Insurance Costs: Tends to increase if the house is in a flood-prone or fire-hazard zones
- PMI: Iff the homeowners have put down less than 20% down, then they will be subject to a Payment Mortgage Insurance(PMI), a monthly fees charged by the lending agency to cover their risk of default on the loan
- Property Taxes: The property taxes vary by state and by county. So first-time home buyers will have to be aware of the rate of taxes in the locality they are buying the house in and plan their monthly escrow payments accordingly to cover the tax bill at the end of the year
- Ongoing Maintenance and Upkeep: Depending on how old the house is and how it's maintained, plan to spend a few hundred dollars with regards to upkeep. Some could be fixed expenses like lawn mowing and upkeep services, water softenereinstallation and upkeep, water filtering systems, HVAC and so on. Although not common, it's good to plan for any eventualities"

What is DNA sequence assembly?,"In bioinformatics, sequence assembly refers to aligning and merging fragments from a longer DNA sequence in order to reconstruct the original sequence. This is needed as DNA sequencing technology might not be able to 'read' whole genomes in one go, but rather reads small pieces of between 20 and 30,000 bases, depending on the technology used. Typically, the short fragments (reads) result from shotgun sequencing genomic DNA, or gene transcript (ESTs).

The problem of sequence assembly can be compared to taking many copies of a book, passing each of them through a shredder with a different cutter, and piecing the text of the book back together just by looking at the shredded pieces. Besides the obvious difficulty of this task, there are some extra practical issues: the original may have many repeated paragraphs, and some shreds may be modified during shredding to have typos. Excerpts from another book may also be added in, and some shreds may be completely unrecognizable."
Should I become an influencer?,"It is important to consider several factors when thinking about becoming an influencer. Influencers usually have a defined niche, and can make up to six figures or more creating content about it. However, at least in the beginning, your income will likely not come in a steady manner, and you may even be investing more into getting set up than you may be earning in return. The work happens in a freelance manner - if you like setting your own schedule this could appeal to you, but the flip side would be that your work bleeds more into your weekends and evenings. Some people also would love the idea of pursuing their hobbies and interest full time, but when they have to treat it as their job, soon become disenchanted. 

In summary, your decision to become an influencer should be based on your financial situation, risk tolerance, and personal working style and interests."

What are the advantages of space based telescopes?,"Space-based telescopes have the advantage of being above the blurring effects of the Earth's atmosphere. In addition, there are many wavelengths from the electromagnetic spectrum that do not reach Earth because they are absorbed or reflected by the Earth's atmosphere. Only the wavelengths of visible light, a portion of infrared, and part of the radio wavelengths reach Earth. To observe other parts of the spectrum - ultraviolet, x-rays, gamma rays or infrared, telescopes have to be outside of Earth's atmosphere. Studying gamma-rays for example, helps astronomers learn more about things like blazars, gamma-ray bursts, pulsars and solar flares than would be possible with just optical telescopes. Similarly, studying x-rays gives invaluable information about the very hot regions of the universe such as exploded stars, clusters of galaxies, and the matter around black holes. The benefits of getting clean, unblurred optical images as well as the ability to observe other parts of the spectrum are worth the expense of putting telescopes in space."

Why do people get sore after working out?,"Muscle soreness occurs because muscle and the connective tissue around it get damaged during exercise, such as weight lifting or high intensity training. This kind of natural breakdown is natural and needed for muscle growth, since muscle grows back stronger during the body's repair process. During this process the affected muscle fibers increase in strength and thickness. 

Additionally, people tend to experience lactic acid buildup prior to exercise as your body uses oxygen to convert glucose to energy. During exercise, if there is a lack of oxygen for this process, you may produce a substance called lactate. Many people believe that soreness comes from the buildup of this lactic acid, but the real contributor is the breakdown of muscle from usage."

What is Remote Sensing?,"Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object, in contrast to in situ or on-site observation. The term is applied especially to acquiring information about Earth and other planets. Remote sensing is used in numerous fields, including geophysics, geography, land surveying and most Earth science disciplines (e.g. exploration geophysics, hydrology, ecology, meteorology, oceanography, glaciology, geology); it also has military, intelligence, commercial, economic, planning, and humanitarian applications, among others.

In current usage, the term remote sensing generally refers to the use of satellite- or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on Earth. It includes the surface and the atmosphere and oceans, based on propagated signals (e.g. electromagnetic radiation). It may be split into ""active"" remote sensing (when a signal is emitted by a satellite or aircraft to the object and its reflection detected by the sensor) and ""passive"" remote sensing (when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor)."

What are the symptoms and causes of migraine headaches?,"The symptoms of migraine headaches include an intense throbbing pain in the head, normally on one side of the head, and can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and loose bowels movements. Some sufferers report impairment to vision either before or during the headache, described as an aura effect, and as such extreme sensitivity to light can be a common symptom.

The causes of migraine headaches are harder to define, and harder as a result to treat. Most medical professionals agree that the causes of migraines are unknown, however there are a number of triggers that can set off a migraine in sufferers. These include dietary triggers such as dehydration, coffee, alcohol and many others. Hormonal changes can also be a trigger, so many women are impacted during their menstrual cycle. Other triggers such as stress and emotional anguish can also cause the onset of migraines. Environmental factors such as bright or flickering lights can also be a trigger.

For most sufferers, rest and non-prescription painkillers such as ibuprofen are sufficient to recover from a headache, but more extreme cases may require a visit to a GP and prescription of triptans to alleviate the symptoms. Other treatments include acupuncture and transcranial stimulation, but ideally understanding and avoiding personal trigger factors is the preferred method."

What is the genomics of disease?,"With the advent of next-generation sequencing we are obtaining enough sequence data to map the genes of complex diseases including infertility, breast cancer or Alzheimer's disease. Genome-wide association studies are a useful approach to pinpoint the mutations responsible for such complex diseases. Through these studies, thousands of DNA variants have been identified that are associated with similar diseases and traits. Furthermore, the possibility for genes to be used at prognosis, diagnosis or treatment is one of the most essential applications. Many studies are discussing both the promising ways to choose the genes to be used and the problems and pitfalls of using genes to predict disease presence or prognosis.

Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of common genetic variants for complex diseases and traits; however, these common variants only explain a small fraction of heritability. Rare variants may account for some of the missing heritability. Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies have rapidly sequenced millions of whole genomes, and such studies have identified hundreds of millions of rare variants. Functional annotations predict the effect or function of a genetic variant and help to prioritize rare functional variants, and incorporating these annotations can effectively boost the power of genetic association of rare variants analysis of whole genome sequencing studies. Some tools have been developed to provide all-in-one rare variant association analysis for whole-genome sequencing data, including integration of genotype data and their functional annotations, association analysis, result summary and visualization. Meta-analysis of whole genome sequencing studies provides an attractive solution to the problem of collecting large sample sizes for discovering rare variants associated with complex phenotypes."
How long do I need to work before I retire?,"Typically you need to work until the age of 65 before you can retire.

Important things to consider before you retire is whether you have enough money to sustain your lifestyle plus account for yearly inflation, and whether you will want to work part time or do consulting work in retirement to keep yourself busy and give you sense of purpose."
Explain the use of screens in basketball,"In basketball, when a team has the ball, one person may set a screen by blocking a defender with his body but making sure his hands are not extended. This allows the person with the ball to pass, shoot, etc. without issuing any fouls. If the person setting a screen moves while screening, the referee will call a moving screen and the ball will be inbounded by the person who moved while screening from the half court line. In any case, screens do not foul the screener for contact unless they are to do physical contact with their hands or feet."

How does the Stock Market work?,"The stock market helps companies raise money to fund operations by selling shares of stock, and it creates and sustains wealth for individual investors.

Companies raise money on the stock market by selling ownership stakes to investors. These equity stakes are known as shares of stock. By listing shares for sale on the stock exchanges that make up the stock market, companies get access to the capital they need to operate and expand their businesses without having to take on debt. In exchange for the privilege of selling stock to the public, companies are required to disclose information and give shareholders a say in how their businesses are run.

Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on the stock market. As companies put that money to work growing and expanding their businesses, investors reap the benefits as their shares of stock become more valuable over time, leading to capital gains. In addition, companies pay dividends to their shareholders as their profits grow.

The performances of individual stocks vary widely over time, but taken as a whole the stock market has historically rewarded investors with average annual returns of around 10%, making it one of the most reliable ways of growing your money."

What is Singlish?,"Singlish (a portmanteau of Singapore and English) (officially similar and related to Singaporean English) is an English-based creole language spoken in Singapore. Singlish arose out of a situation of prolonged language contact between speakers of many different languages in Singapore, including Hokkien, Malay, Teochew, Cantonese and Tamil.

Singlish originated with the arrival of the British and the establishment of English-medium education in Singapore. Elements of English quickly filtered out of schools and onto the streets, resulting in the development of a pidgin language spoken by non-native speakers as a lingua franca used for communication between speakers of the many different languages used in Singapore. Singlish evolved mainly among the working classes who learned elements of English without formal schooling, mixing in elements of their native languages. After some time, this new pidgin language, now combined with substantial influences from Indian English, Peranakan, southern varieties of Chinese, Malay, and Tamil, became the primary language of the streets. As Singlish grew in popularity, children began to acquire Singlish as their native language, a process known as creolization. Through this process of creolization, Singlish became a fully-formed, stabilized and independent creole language, acquiring a more robust vocabulary and more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding.

Singlish shares many linguistic similarities with Manglish or Bazaar Malay of Malaysia, although a few distinctions can be made, particularly in vocabulary. Manglish generally receives more Malay influence and Singlish more Chinese (Mandarin, Hokkien, etc.) influence. Initially, Singlish and Manglish were essentially the same dialect evolving from the British Malaya economy, born in the trading ports of Singapore, Malacca and Penang when Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia were for many purposes a de facto (from 1963 to 1965, de jure) single entity. Ever since the two countries separated, a divergence has been observed.

Like all languages, Singlish and other creole languages show consistent internal logic and grammatical complexity. Due to its origins, Singlish shares many similarities with other English-based creole languages. As with many other creole languages, it is sometimes incorrectly perceived to be a ""broken"" form of the lexifier language - in this case, English. The uniqueness of Singlish has been studied by linguistics experts beyond Singapore."

What is the difference between Azure Synapse Dedicated SQL Pools and Serverless SQL Pools?,"Azure Synapse Dedicated SQL pools is based on the legacy on-prem MS SQL Server technology of the past, while Azure Synapse SQL Serverless Pools is a new technology built from the ground up by a different Microsoft team using a modern distributed query processing engine reading files directly on top of ADLS.

Based on these two SQL solutions having completely different architectures they have widely different capabilities, where Synapse Serverless SQL Pools have:
- Great support for legacy T-SQL
- Great integration with Power BI
- Good Support for reading open format files directly from ADLS (including Delta Lake)

However, Serverless SQL Pools has:
- NO support for data writing (no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE capability), because all integration must happen externally on files.
- NO result caching, so dashboards or queries that are run multiple times will pay in time and money for each execution even if just run seconds ago.
- NO file caching, so cloud storage API can be high and flood the network and slow a larger installation"

Explain the black and white smoke during the Pope election,"Beginning in the early 1800s, the ballots used by cardinals were burned after each ballot to indicate a failed election. The lack of smoke instead signalled a successful election. Since 1914, black smoke (fumata nera) emerging from a temporary chimney installed on the roof of the Sistine Chapel indicates that the ballot did not result in an election, while white smoke (fumata bianca) announces that a new pope has been chosen.

Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII changed the form of ballot to use unsigned ballots, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above had the effect of making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. The lack of sealing wax on the ballots explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 conclave. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color on the first day of that conclave.

Since 1963, chemicals have been added to the burning process to augment the smoke's black or white color. Beginning in 2005, a successful election is also accentuated by bells ringing at the appearance of the white smoke.

During the 2013 conclave, the Vatican disclosed the chemicals used to color the smoke—the black smoke comprises potassium perchlorate, anthracene, and sulfur; the white smoke is composed of potassium chlorate, lactose, and pine rosin."

What is the best way to tune a snare drum?,"The best way to tune a drum depends on which system the drum uses for tension. Newer technologies such as Dialtune's cable tuning system allow a drummer to quickly and evenly tune a drum head by turning separate dials for the top and bottom head. 

Traditional lug and tension rod drums use a drum key and require more attention to detail. For these drums, start by getting all tension rods finger-tight. Bring the snare drum up to tension with a full turn of a drum key of each one, moving in a star pattern around the drum. Use a drumstick to tap around the drum by each tension rod and listen for a consistent sound. 

Once you have the overall sound in the range you’re looking for, test the pitch by tapping around the drum. For the snare’s resonant head, detune it like the batter head. Tune it ‘tabletop tight’: so flat you could confidently rest a drink on it (don’t do this, though). Bring up each tension rod another quarter turn. You want to hear the wires, but not so much that it overwhelms the attack. Tap the head beside each tension rod, then start to even out the pitch with the tension rods so they all match."

Explain away goal rule in soccer.,"Away goal rule was first introduced in 1965/66 season of the UEFA European Cups Winners’ Cup and abolished at the end of 2020/21 season. All of the UEFA club competitions’ knock-out stages (except the final) are played as a two-leg fixtures (team plays one game at home and one game away against the same team). The away goal rule was a tie breaker in case the winner of the fixture in the knock-out stage could not be determined after adding up scores from both games. In case there is a  tie when you add up the scores of both games, the team that scored more away goals would advance to the next round of the competition. For example, if Team A lost the first game 2:1 playing away and won the second game with the score of 1:0 at home, the aggregate score of those two games is 2:2 (a tie), but since Team A scored 1 goal playing away and Team B scored 0 away goals, Team A would advance the next round."

What is a mitochondrial matrix?,"In the mitochondrion, the matrix is the space within the inner membrane. The word ""matrix"" stems from the fact that this space is viscous, compared to the relatively aqueous cytoplasm. The mitochondrial matrix contains the mitochondrial DNA, ribosomes, soluble enzymes, small organic molecules, nucleotide cofactors, and inorganic ions. The enzymes in the matrix facilitate reactions responsible for the production of ATP, such as the citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, oxidation of pyruvate, and the beta oxidation of fatty acids.

The composition of the matrix based on its structures and contents produce an environment that allows the anabolic and catabolic pathways to proceed favorably for. The electron transport chain and enzymes in the matrix play a large role in the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The citric acid cycle produces NADH and FADH2 through oxidation that will be reduced in oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP.

The cytosolic, intermembrane space, compartment has a water content of 3.8 μL/mg protein, while the mitochondrial matrix 0.8 μL/mg protein. It is not known how mitochondria maintain osmotic balance across the inner mitochondrial membrane, although the membrane contains aquaporins that are believed to be conduits for regulated water transport. Mitochondrial matrix has a pH of about 7.8, which is higher than the pH of the intermembrane space of the mitochondria, which is around 7.0–7.4. Mitochondrial DNA was discovered by Nash and Margit in 1963. One to many double stranded mainly circular DNA is present in mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondrial DNA is 1% of total DNA of a cell. It is rich in guanine and cytosine content. Mitochondria of mammals have 55s ribosomes."

why is context switching bad for computer performance?,"context switching, which occurs when a process is paused by the cpu and another process starts running can affect performance of a computer systems for a couple of reasons. The act of switching the context is not in itself very time consuming. The real performance hit comes from the fact that different processes have different virtual memory address spaces so all the caches in the system need to be invalidated and flushed. Since there is such a huge difference in how fast a cpu can run compared to how fast instructions and data can be retrieved from main memory, these things are cached close to the cpu in onboard caches. Even a pointer to a mapping of virtual addresses to physical addresses are cached so that memory access is faster. When a new process gets loaded by the cpu with a different address space and mapping of virtual to physical addresses, all of the data in the caches is invalid and needs to be flushed. This leaves the cpu with empty caches that have to be rebuilt from scratch for the new process, meaning there will be a big slowdown in retrieving instructions and data since these will now be coming from main memory, which is much slower than the cpu's cache."

The aperture is how widely open the lens is and how much light is allowed to pass through it. A low f-stop or big aperture will minimize the depth of field, while a high f-stop or small aperture will maximize it. Depth of field is an element that photographers use in composition to blur or sharpen elements of the photograph, thus emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain aspects."

What is the difference between the Scala Future onComplete and andThen functions?,"Both `andThen` and `onComplete` allow you to observe the result of some future via a callback function. However, `andThen` can be chained, and unlike `onComplete`, it guarantees the order in which callback functions will be applied. In addition, the callback given to `andThen` may be a partial function, handling only a subset of outcomes (e.g., only `Success` or only `Failure`).

Consider the following example using `andThen` and `map`:

```
def demoAndThen(fut: Future[Int]): Future[Int] = {
  fut.andThen { case Success(value) => println(s""andThen1: $value"") }
    .andThen { case Success(value) => println(s""andThen2: $value"") }
    .map { i =>
      println(s""map: $i"")
      i
    }
}
```

When `fut` completes successfully, ""andthen1: ..."", ""andThen2: ..."" and ""map: ..."" will be printed in that order.

Consider the analogous example using `onComplete` and `map`:

```
def demoOnComplete(fut: Future[Int]): Future[Int] = {
  fut.onComplete { t: Try[Int] => println(s""onComplete1: $t"") }
  fut.onComplete { t: Try[Int] => println(s""onComplete2: $t"") }
  fut.map { i =>
    println(s""map: $i"")
    i
  }
}
```

In this case, when `fut` completes successfully, ""onComplete1: ..."", ""onComplete2: ..."" and ""map: ..."" will be printed in some unspecified order.

Although `andThen` is chained, the callback function does not generally affect the outcome of the resulting `Future`. But be aware: if the callback throws some fatal errors, the resulting future will never complete."

What position is best to use in your Fantasy Football flex slot?,"The majority of fantasy football players believe it is best to use a running-back in your flex spot because running-backs traditionally receive the ball (touches) more often than wider receivers or tight-ends.  More touches theoretically means more opportunities to score points.  However, with recent NFL rule changes, stronger and faster wide receivers, and fantasy football scoring systems that provide extra points for catching a pass (catches) wide receivers are scoring significantly more points than running backs on a weekly basis.  Therefore, it is advised to play a wider receiver in your fantasy football flex spot."

How long can you store cooked food in refrigerators?,"A common misconception is the assumption that food ""loses nutrients"" when it's refrigerated. That is not as true as you think it is. It is always good to ask 2 follow up questions
What nutrients exactly? And by how much?
It turns out that water soluble vitamins are the most unstable and easily lost nutrients, but fun fact: most of the loss happens during cooking, not refrigeration. It is heat that destroys vitamins, not cold. In fact, in an airtight container, most cooked food will last 2-3 days at the minimum and up to a week in many cases. In the freezer, food will last up to 6 months (assuming no power cuts). All biological activity slows down with temperature.

There are a few exceptions - plain cooked/steamed rice can sometimes be infected by a bacteria that doesn't mind low temperatures, so it's best to consume it within 1-2 days.

Bonus point: Indian food, is uniquely fridge friendly because it tends to be spicy, salty and sour - these are three conditions microbes absolutely hate."

When we say bond yield increases, it is referring to the newly issued bond will have a higher yield than previously issued bond.

Tell me about the first commercial winery in California.,"The first commercial winery in California was founded in 1857 by Hungarian-American Agoston Haraszthy who is referred to as the ""Father of California Wine"" (this moniker also is applied to Spanish Jesuit missionary, Father Junípero Serra).

The winery was acquired at auction and original vines replanted and reopened in the 1940s. In 1984, the winery estate expanded an additional 1,000 acres after it was purchased by a West German company.

What is the relationship between interest rates and the economy?,"Central banks typically adjust interest rates as a way to influence inflation and economic growth. When a country is experiencing high rates of inflation, its central bank will typically increase the interest rate which will increase the cost of credit and therefore reduce economic demand and consumption. Reduced demand will lead to reduced prices and less inflation. When a country is experiencing deflation, the central bank will typically decrease interest rates to reduce cost of credit and increase consumption. Central banks must be careful with interest rates. High interest rates for a sustained period of time can lead to a recession. Whereas, low interest rates for a sustained period of time can lead to hyperinflation and an overheated economy."

Wthat is the difference between Speed and Velocity ?,"Speed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas velocity describes both how fast and in which direction the object is moving. If a car is said to travel at 60 miles per hour, its speed has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60 miles per hour to the north, its velocity has now been specified.

The big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a circle. When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average velocity is zero, but its average speed is found by dividing the circumference of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This is because the average velocity is calculated by considering only the displacement between the starting and end points, whereas the average speed considers only the total distance travelled."

How should I select a tennis racket if I'm completely new to the sport?,"If you're a beginner tennis player, you should pick a racket that will help you learn the game quickly. There are a few key factors to consider. The first factor is grip size. There are several ways to measure grip size, but the simplest is to hold the grip and ensure there is about a finger's width remaining between your ring finger and base of your thumb when you hold the racket. Too small a grip may lead to squeezing the racket too hard, and too large a grip will make the racket unwieldy. The second factor is the weight of the racket. A racket in the range of 250 to 310 grams (unstrung) will be suitable for most players. A beginner male player might shoot for something in the 280-305 gram range, and a beginner female might use a racket in the 275-300 gram range. Junior players (age 10+), depending on age and size, should consider rackets in the 250 to 300 gram range. The third factor is the racket head size. You should look for a 100-105 square inch head size. These days even professionals use 100 sq inch commonly, and 95 is considered small (for advanced players). The racket composition is not a key differentiator, as most rackets are made of some sort of graphite composite material. Price is also not an indication of quality. Pricier rackets might be less suited to beginners, in fact. As to brand, it's a very personal choice. I would say choose a brand that you associate with wanting to play (perhaps you're a fan of a player who is sponsored by that brand). You can certainly find rackets at many big box retailers that would check all these boxes. And if you're not sure -- many online as well as local racket retailers run ""demo"" programs allowing you to try different rackets. Choose one that helps you consistently make contact with the ball and get it over the net. The most important thing is to get out on the court and play!"

Why is the green card process so long and complex for people from India and China?,"The US Immigration system issues Permanent Residence cards, also known as green cards, which lets people reside and work on a permanent basis in the United States. The number of green cards issued each year is fixed at 140000 and each country is capped with a 7% quota i.e. no more than 9800 green cards can be issued to residents of a single country. Since there are hundreds of thousands of people who come to work in the US from India and China every year, they have to wait several years before they become eligible for a green card. This long delay can disrupt the lives of these people since the work visa they have does not grant them permission to reside and work in the US on a permanent basis, and they may have to leave the US, along with their families, if their work visa expires."

How did 'March Madness' get its name?,"""March Madness"" was originally coined after a high school basketball tournament in Illinois dating back to 1908. Henry V. Porter wrote an essay titled ""March Madness"" in the Illinois Interscholastic in 1939 to commemorate the tournament. Other media outlets embraced the term as the tournament continued to sell out and thrive for decades. Brent Musburger, a former sportswriter from Chicago, brought the term ""March Madness"" to the NCAA tournament when covering the event for CBS in 1982. The phrase became synonymous with the tournament ever since. In 2010, the NCAA made it official and paid IHSA (The Illinois High School Association) $17.2M for the rights to the phrase, and began using the trademark in marketing materials, logos and other branding material. While only used for the men's tournament for decades, the NCAA only began using the phrase ""March Madness"" for the women's tournament in 2022."

How do archaeologists study the past?,"Archaeologists study the past by implementing a variety of scientific strategies that include survey, excavation, analysis, interpretation, and reporting. They begin by determining an area of interest to be studied. They then survey that area using a variety of methods that include laying in a grid system for testing the area of interest to locate sites.  Next, they excavate, or dig, to find evidence of past habitations. This results in recovering material culture, or artifacts. The artifacts are then taken to a laboratory where they are analyzed. This analysis including cleaning the artifacts, determining dates and functions, and entering those artifacts into a database where further statistical analysis may be performed. Once all this data is gathered and analyzed, archaeologist need to interpret what they have found. This data can tell you when a site was occupied, who lived there, what they were eating, and what time of year a site was occupied. Once the archaeologists have interpreted the data the write a report detailing the work that was done and their interpretation of the site. The report is very detailed as archaeological excavation destroys the sites being studying. The report includes photographs, field notes, and an inventory of the artifacts recovered as well as an interpretation of the site."

How is it that some high net-worth individuals are able to avoid paying taxes completely?,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxes regular income and investment income differently. For one type of common investment income i.e long term capital gains, the tax rates are 0%, 15% and 20% based on the annual income of the individual. The income used for calculating the above rates doesn't include income from the long term capital gains itself. For example, if an individual makes less than $41,675 for the year 2022 through regular income, his or her capital gains tax rate would be 0% even if the long term capital gains itself is more than a million dollars. Assuming many of these high net-worth individuals don't have any regular income and all their income is through long term capital gains, they end up paying no taxes at all."

Why should I use toothpaste,"Toothpaste is a paste or gel dentifrice used with a toothbrush to clean and maintain the aesthetics and health of teeth. Toothpaste is used to promote oral hygiene: it is an abrasive that aids in removing dental plaque and food from the teeth, assists in suppressing halitosis, and delivers active ingredients (most commonly fluoride) to help prevent tooth decay (dental caries) and gum disease (gingivitis). Owing to differences in composition and fluoride content, not all toothpastes are equally effective in maintaining oral health. The decline of tooth decay during the 20th century has been attributed to the introduction and regular use of fluoride-containing toothpastes worldwide. Large amounts of swallowed toothpaste can be toxic. Common colors for toothpaste include white (sometimes with colored stripes or green tint) and blue.

Usefulness
Toothpastes are generally useful to maintain dental health. Toothpastes containing fluoride are effective at preventing tooth decay. Toothpastes may also help to control and remove plaque build-up, promoting healthy gums. A 2016 systematic review indicated that using toothpaste when brushing the teeth does not necessarily impact the level of plaque removal. However, the active ingredients in toothpastes are able to prevent dental diseases with regular use.

Ingredients
Toothpastes are derived from a variety of components, the three main ones being abrasives, fluoride, and detergent."

If more than one car arrives at the same time, then the car to the right has the right of way. An electric traffic light typically has three different signals: red indicates drivers should stop until the light changes; a yellow light indicates that the driver should stop if it is safe to do so because the signal is changing from red to green; and a green light means that drivers may proceed through the intersection without stopping."

What is fractional-reserve banking?,"Fractional-reserve banking is the system of banking operating in almost all countries worldwide, under which banks that take deposits from the public are required to hold a proportion of their deposit liabilities in liquid assets as a reserve, and are at liberty to lend the remainder to borrowers. Bank reserves are held as cash in the bank or as balances in the bank's account at the central bank. The country's central bank determines the minimum amount that banks must hold in liquid assets, called the ""reserve requirement"" or ""reserve ratio"". Most commercial banks hold more than this minimum amount as excess reserves.

Bank deposits are usually of a relatively short-term duration, and may be ""at call"", while loans made by banks tend to be longer-term, resulting in a risk that customers may at any time collectively wish to withdraw cash out of their accounts in excess of the bank reserves. The reserves only provide liquidity to cover withdrawals within the normal pattern. Banks and the central bank expect that in normal circumstances only a proportion of deposits will be withdrawn at the same time, and that reserves will be sufficient to meet the demand for cash. However, banks may find themselves in a shortfall situation when depositors wish to withdraw more funds than the reserves held by the bank. In that event, the bank experiencing the liquidity shortfall may borrow short-term funds in the interbank lending market from banks with a surplus. In exceptional situations, such as during an unexpected bank run, the central bank may provide funds to cover the short-term shortfall as lender of last resort."

Any tips for figuring out where to enter the water when surfing a new beach?,"There is a lot of local knowledge required to be efficient at entering the water of a new beach.  It helps to know what kind of a wave break it is - is it a surf break or a reef break for example.  But if you see others in the water and it looks like a reasonable surf spot then here are a couple of pointers.  First, stand on the beach and watch what is happening for 3-5 minutes.  You'll soak up a lot just taking the time to really observe.  Second, check-out where the other surfers are entering and where they are swimming out to.  Obvious, I know, but surprisingly people will sometimes skip this step.  Third, see if you can figure out where the channels are - he channel is where the waves are breaking towards.  If you see two waves coming toward the shore in synchronization with each other, but separated by a patch of calmer water in between - the channel is typically below that calmer water."
What is epistatis?,"Epistasis is a phenomenon in genetics in which the effect of a gene mutation is dependent on the presence or absence of mutations in one or more other genes, respectively termed modifier genes. In other words, the effect of the mutation is dependent on the genetic background in which it appears. Epistatic mutations therefore have different effects on their own than when they occur together. Originally, the term epistasis specifically meant that the effect of a gene variant is masked by that of a different gene.

The concept of epistasis originated in genetics in 1907 but is now used in biochemistry, computational biology and evolutionary biology. The phenomenon arises due to interactions, either between genes (such as mutations also being needed in regulators of gene expression) or within them (multiple mutations being needed before the gene loses function), leading to non-linear effects. Epistasis has a great influence on the shape of evolutionary landscapes, which leads to profound consequences for evolution and for the evolvability of phenotypic traits."

What is the most important element of swimming breaststroke?,"Timing is the most important aspect of swimming breaststroke. The swimmer needs to make sure to do the leg stroke (kicking) at a moment when the body is streamlined and presents the least resistance to the water. To achieve that, the arm stroke should be finished or almost finished before kicking begins. After kicking it is important to keep the streamlined position for some time to maintain the speed through gliding. The exact duration of gliding depends on the target distance of a given event or race. The longer the distance of the race is, the longer the gliding phase should be. For example, for a 50m race the gliding phase could be below 1 second, while for a 200m race it may be over 2 seconds."

What are the benefits of Microservices?,"Microservices break up Monolithic Architecture into standalone lightweight services that serve a single purpose.  Developer productivity is increased as teams dedicated to the single responsibility service can control releases independent of other services.  They can also control the language the service is written in.  This is helpful when certain services might benefit from being written in Python vs C#, Java or Javascript.  Microservices advocate for an event driven architecture where services are not coupled or referenced directly.  Each Microservice can publish events that can be consumed/subscribed by other services.  Containerization and Microservices go well together when designing Microservices, considering that the paradigm calls for Containers to be immutable and treated as Cattle.  New and Old versions of the same Microservice can be released side by side in an A/B pattern, helping with assurance of any updates.  Containers can host the Microservices quickly and be tested across environments with reliability ensuring all dependencies are encapsulated in the build of the running image."

This generally occurs in two ways: the defense intercepting a pass or recovering a fumble. A turnover on downs occurs only on the fourth and last down of a set of downs; the offense attempts to gain the yardage required to be given a new set of downs but fails to do so by means other than the defense's takeaway, such as an incomplete pass, or the ball carrier being tackled short of the line to gain."

What is the holographic principle?,"The holographic principle is an axiom in string theories and a supposed property of quantum gravity that states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as encoded on a lower-dimensional boundary to the region — such as a light-like boundary like a gravitational horizon.

The holographic principle states that the entropy of ordinary mass (not just black holes) is also proportional to surface area and not volume; that volume itself is illusory and the universe is really a hologram which is isomorphic to the information ""inscribed"" on the surface of its boundary.

First proposed by Gerard 't Hooft, it was given a precise string-theory interpretation by Leonard Susskind, who combined his ideas with previous ones of 't Hooft and Charles Thorn. Leonard Susskind said, “The three-dimensional world of ordinary experience––the universe filled with galaxies, stars, planets, houses, boulders, and people––is a hologram, an image of reality coded on a distant two-dimensional surface."" As pointed out by Raphael Bousso, Thorn observed in 1978 that string theory admits a lower-dimensional description in which gravity emerges from it in what would now be called a holographic way. The prime example of holography is the AdS/CFT correspondence."

Why is job training such as upskilling and reskilling so important?,"The degree of importance of job training differs based on the government as job training is much more important in a capitalist economy versus a communist economy.  Assuming a capitalist economy, job training is important because of market dynamics, supply and demand.  In this case, demand are the available jobs and supply are the skilled workers who provide work in those jobs.  As technology advances, new innovations are made and cyclical market segments ebb and flow, the demand for highly skilled workers changes.  Upskilling is important as it helps workers to maintain valuable skills in their given field and the goal is to keep up with the technology advances in their respective field.  Reskilling is most often more closely linked to cyclical market forces where the demand for jobs in one field go down and another go up; reskilling is acquiring skills in the field with growing demand for jobs when a worker possesses skills in a field with declining demand for jobs or their skills."

What is the best way to lose weight?,"The best way to lose weight is to be in a calorie deficit. This means that you are consuming less calories than you expend. An easy way to confirm this deficit is to track your calorie intake with a calorie tracking application like MyFitnessPal. This helps you better understand the macronutrient composition (protein, carbohydrates, fat) of your food, and which foods are more calorically dense than others. One gram of protein has 4 calories per gram, one gram of carbohydrate has 4 calories per gram, and one gram of fat has 9 calories per gram. Each food that you consume is either one or a combination of these three macronutrients. It is possible to expend calories to create a larger deficit through exercise. There are many types of exercise, but most types can be categorized as either cardiovascular training or weight training. Both types of exercise are important, as cardiovascular exercises, such as walking, running, and biking, train your heart and burn calories during exercise. Weight-based training involves challenging your muscles with loads in order to make them stronger to handle larger loads and more volume. Weight-based training does not burn as many calories during exercise, however this type of training taxes your muscles so that they need to repair and thus burns more calories throughout the day after your training session. Weight-based training is important for strong muscles, bones, and tendons. The best way to lose weight involves a combination of a calorie-controlled diet, cardiovascular exercise, and weight-based training exercise sustained over a duration of time until you meet your weight goal. Once you meet your goal, it is then important to sustain these good habits and not revert back to the habits and behaviors you were previously engaged in that contributed to your weight gain."

That night, the men break into John's home and kill the puppy before stealing the car. Iosef takes the Mustang to a chop shop to remove its identifying details, but the shop owner, Aurelio, recognizes the vehicle and refuses service. John learns from Aurelio that Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the boss of the city's Russian mafia.

Learning of his son's actions, Viggo beats and berates Iosef for incurring John's wrath. Viggo reveals that John was formerly a hitman in his employ, renowned and feared in the criminal underworld as the ""Baba Yaga,"" a ruthless and relentless ""man of focus, commitment, and sheer will."" After John fell in love with Helen, a civilian, Viggo gave him a seemingly ""impossible task"" to earn his freedom.

John recovers his concealed stash from his former career, including weapons and gold coins used as underworld currency for special services. He refuses Viggo's attempt to make amends for his son's actions and kills the hit squad subsequently sent to his home. As a result, Viggo puts a $2 million bounty on John's head, and his former mentor Marcus is enlisted to take him out. John lodges in the city at the Continental, a luxurious hotel that serves as neutral ground for the underworld and where conducting criminal ""business"" is strictly forbidden. The hotel's owner and John's old friend, Winston, secretly informs John that Iosef is at the Red Circle nightclub. John infiltrates the club and confronts Iosef, but he is attacked by Kirill, Viggo's henchman, and forced to retreat to the Continental for medical attention.

As John rests, he is targeted by a hitwoman named Ms. Perkins, who sneaks into his room. Marcus sees Perkins from an adjacent building and fires a warning shot to alert John. He wakes up and subdues Perkins, who reveals that Viggo doubled the bounty for her to kill him in the hotel. She also discloses that Viggo has a high-value stash concealed in a church. John has another hitman, Harry, secure Perkins, but she escapes and kills Harry.

At the church, John destroys Viggo's cache of cash and extensive blackmail material. When Viggo arrives to assess the damage, John assaults him and his men but is captured after being hit by Kirill's car. John tells Viggo that he will not stop until Iosef is dead because the puppy gave him hope and a chance to not be alone in his grief for Helen. Marcus intervenes again to save John, allowing him to kill Kirill and threaten Viggo into revealing his son's location. John assaults the safehouse and kills Iosef. Afterward, Marcus encourages John to return to the everyday life he has built, but their meeting is witnessed by Perkins, who reveals Marcus's duplicity to Viggo. He has Marcus tortured and killed before calling John to taunt him with the details, drawing him back to the city.

Perkins is executed at Winston's behest for breaking the Continental's rules, and Winston informs John that Viggo is preparing to leave the city by helicopter. John races to the New York Harbor, where he fights and mortally wounds Viggo. Resigned to dying from his own injuries, John watches a video on his phone of Helen telling him they need to go home. He breaks into a nearby animal clinic, treats his wounds, and adopts a pitbull puppy scheduled to be euthanized before beginning the walk home."

What kind of disease is wheat mildew,"Wheat mildew is a wheat disease that affects the ear, and is brought on by causes somewhat similar to those that cause blight, though at a more advanced period of the season. If this disorder comes on immediately after the first appearance of the ear, the straw is also affected—but if the grain is nearly or fully formed, injury to the straw is less discernible. Wheat may mildew where the straw is perfectly fresh, but only rarely. A severe mildew, however, retards further grain and straw maturation and leads to death. Something akin to mildew is the gum, which, in all warm moist seasons, attaches itself to the ear, and often causes considerable damage. All these different disorders are generally accompanied by insects, and by minute parasitic vegetable growths, considered by many to be the cause of the damage. Their appearance, however, may justly be attributed to the diseased state of the plant; for wherever putrefaction takes place, either in animal or vegetable substances, the presence of these parasites will never be wanting.

Another disorder that affects wheat is brought on by excessive heat, which makes the plants suffer from malnutrition, and become sickly and feeble. In this atrophic state a kind of dust gathers on the stalks and leaves, which increases with the disease, till the plant is in a great measure worn out and exhausted. The only remedy in this case, and it is one that cannot easily be administered by the hand of man, is a plentiful supply of moisture, by which, if it is received before consumption is too far advanced, the crop is benefited in a degree proportional to the extent of nourishment received, and the stage at which the disease has arrived.

Some people have recommended using blighted and mildewed wheat for seed. This, however may be hazardous. Light or defective wheat does vegetate and produce a plant, but the plant may be of poor quality and incapable of withstanding winter blasts."

What is the Spengler Cup,"The Spengler Cup is an annual invitational ice hockey tournament held in Davos, Switzerland.

The event is hosted by the Swiss team HC Davos and played each year in Davos from 26 December to 31 inclusively. Currently, all games are held at the Eisstadion Davos.

It was originally devised by Dr. Carl Spengler as a means to promote teams from German-speaking Europe, who might have suffered ostracism in the aftermath of World War I. Eventually, the tournament grew well beyond expectations. Many of Europe's most prestigious clubs and national programs have appeared, including Soviet, Czechoslovak, Swedish, German, and Finnish powerhouses. Through its history, club or national teams from 13 countries have won the tournament, with Team Canada winning the most cups as a club (16) while various teams from Switzerland have won the most cups for one country (20).

Among non-European organizations, Team Canada, Team USA, nationally ranked U.S. collegiate teams, reigning AHL Calder Cup and Ontario Hockey Association champions, and even Team Japan (in 1971, building international experience before playing as hosts of the 1972 Sapporo Winter Olympics) have competed for the Spengler Cup. Since at least 1990, Team Canada has been the only participant from North America, with the exception of the AHL's Rochester Americans in 1996 and 2013 (see AHL participation at the Spengler Cup).

In the 2018 tournament, Finnish club team KalPa from the city of Kuopio defeated Team Canada 2–1 in the final. The game was decided in the 8th round of a shootout, the first series of game-winning shots in tournament history that determined the winner of the Spengler Cup.

The Spengler Cup tournament was not played in 2020 or 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2022 tournament, Swiss club team HC Ambrì-Piotta defeated Sparta Prague 3–2 in the final; with the game decided in the 5th round of a shootout."

The interval between each successive pair of strings is a perfect fourth, except the major third interval between G and B, making some figures and phrases 'translate' horizontally across the neck. The perfect fourth interval helps avoid long finger stretches in comparison to the perfect fifth intervals on smaller instruments like the violin. The introduction of a major third between G and B means that the total interval between 1st and 6th string is 24 semitones, or 2 octaves, making the open guitar strings fall more easily into chords, aiding fretting of basic chords with fewer fingers."

How to people buy parts for classic cars that are no longer in production?,"A challenge to owning a classic car is buying replacement parts when original components fail. There are a few options, some specialty supply houses create reproduction parts, but depending on the popularity of the car the availability is mixed, it can take some time for a custom part to be fabricated and it can be a costly option.  If the failed part is on hand, you can take the part to a local supply house, and compare the specs to modern parts in the parts catalog, and select the closest matching part. This is a good option for items like fuel filters and brake pads that have similar dimensions and functionality of the original part. In some cases, it may be easier to upgrade a component, such as removing a generator and replacing it with an alternator to upgrade the reliability of the classic car."

How can you take good star photos?,"Taking good star photos requires 3 critical elements: good observation conditions, good equipment and plenty of time. Picking a dark site without a lot of light pollution that's away from cities and other strong sources of light is a must. The weather also has to be clear, without clouds, and preferably on a night without full moon which is another source of light pollution. On the equipment side, if you're planning to use a cellphone, make sure that it has a night mode and you have a way to keep it immobile for the duration of the photo, which could take 4 or more minutes. You will get better results with a digital camera as those have larger lenses which can capture more light. Also remember that the longer the photo, the more the earth will turn, causing your starts to appear as trails in the photo - which may or may not be desired. For professional looking photos you'll need a telescope, and remember that no matter what you do, your photos won't look anything like those coming from Hubble and other large telescopes. Lastly, plan on spending plenty of time - the longer the exposure the better you can see the stars, and you might want to take several photos - try different parts of the sky, see what happens when you include the ground or not, and remember to let your eyes adjust to the dark and look around yourself, while you're taking the photos!"

How comes a free-diver does not get crushed by the pressure when diving?,"Every 10 meters under water, the pressure increases by 1 bar, which is approximately one standard atmosphere unit.
This means for example at 50 meters deep, the pressure the diver is receiving is six times higher than at the surface.
For most of the body, composed of tissues and fluids, this is not a problem as they are incompressible.
However, the air contained in the lungs being pressurised will reduce in volume inversely proportionally to the pressure. 
If the individual dives with a tank, he will be able to inflate his lungs, but if the diver is free-diving, the volume of air is limited (being the one taken at the surface).
In our previous example, the volume contained in the lungs would be divided by 6, which is in principle below their residual volume.
This means lungs will not be able to deform themselves anymore, and a depression will appear in the thorax of the free-diver
hence risking the lungs to collapse.
The latter would though not happen, as the depression created in the lungs from not being able to get deformed anymore will generate an influx of blood that strengthen the lungs structure, protecting them from being damaged."

The simplest mathematical realization of spatial network is a lattice or a random geometric graph (see figure in the right), where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the Euclidean distance is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. Transportation and mobility networks, Internet, mobile phone networks, power grids, social and contact networks and biological neural networks are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's topology alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure, resilience and the evolution of spatial networks is crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology."

Who is the best soccer player in the world?,"There are many ways to determine who the best soccer player is at the current time.

Mbappe is thought to be the best young player in the game now, gracing the cover of the popular FIFA video game for the last two years.

Still more could argue that the player with the most goals scored would be the best player. That would make Cristiano Ronaldo the top player in the world, with his all-time record of more than 800 goals for club and country. Right behind him is his rival Lionel Messi, who also has collected far more assists than his Portuguese counterpart. Young striker Erling Haaland may have something to say about that, however, as his incredible start to the Premier League season has seen him on pace to shatter the league's single-season goalscoring record.

However, that seems to discount those who play other positions, like 2018 Ballon d'Or winner Luka Modric, whose midfield brilliance led Croatia to the last World Cup final, or 2022 Yashin trophy winner Thibaut Courtois, whose goalkeeping heroics earned him Man of the Match in the 2022 Champions League final."

The guide RNAs are designed to target specific regions of the genome adjacent to the transcription start sites of each gene, allowing for specific and efficient gene activation or repression. GeneBass experiments typically involve the transduction of large numbers of cells, followed by selection or sorting of cells based on specific phenotypes of interest. High-throughput sequencing of the guide RNA library before and after selection can be used to identify genes that are essential for specific cellular processes or that are involved in disease pathways."

Why is film photography popular again?,"Film photography had seen a long decline in popularity ever since the invention of digital cameras with their remarkable leaps in technological advances. As of today, a decent professional digital camera significantly outperforms the 35mm film cameras in terms of resolution, burst-shooting capabilities, nearly unlimited storage, and etc... In the recent years, the ""film look"" has made its comeback with lower resolution, grainy texture and unique color rendition. On top of that, half-decent retro-looking film cameras can be acquired for much less than a potent digital camera, lowering the entry barrier for those on the budget and looking for that look. An abundant pool of film stocks also adds to the fun, where each can drastically differ in low-light sensitivity, color rendition, graininess, post-processing chemistry, and of course, price. However, many major photographic film producers have either discontinued or significantly reduced the volume of their production. This, coupled with the surge in the demand, has led to skyrocketing prices on most of the still-available film stocks. On top of this, many popular and sought-after film cameras like the Leica M6, Nikon FM2 and Contax T2 also saw steep increase in their used-market prices. Given these price hikes on films and decades-old equipments, film photography is quickly becoming an expensive hobby, where each click of a shutter could cost more than 50 cents. How ironic is this today, when digital storage is virtually free? The authentic ""film look"" carries a hefty price tag today, and the future popularity of film photograhy is uncertain."

The setlists of their live shows are never been repeated, each one is different.  Each of the musicians is virtuosic in their instrument - Trey Anastasio on guitar, Page McConnell on Keyboard, Mike Gordon on bass, and Jon Fishman on drums.  Their live shows are high energy and the music takes fans on a journey.  Their lighting director, Chris Kuroda, is known as the fifth member of the band as the lighting meshes seamlessly with the music.  Phish has been together since 1983 and over the course of the past 40 years they have hundreds of original songs as well as incorporating their own take on many cover songs.  The lyrics range from whimsical to melancholic but are more often geared towards the whimsical side.  Phish is regarded as being one of the most influential bands, along with the Grateful Dead, in the jam band music scene.  Like the Grateful Dead, their fans tend to be incredibly devoted, often traveling to see many shows in a single tour."

It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Food coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases."
What foods does a tortoise eat?,"Tortoises eat a range of fruit and vegetables although the mainstay of a tortoise’s diet should be green leafy vegetables such as dandelions, clover, lettuce, vetch and kale. Your tortoise will enjoy sweet fruits such as bananas, strawberries, peaches and apples but these should be given no more than twice a week as the sugar can interfere with their digestive system. They can also become addicted to sweet fruits and you will find they might refuse to eat their healthy greens in favour of something sweet. 

Tortoises should eat a daily portion of food that is equivalent to their shell size. Ideally, they should also have 1 - 2 days a week when they don’t eat. This is because they have slow digestive systems and need a clear day or two for their systems to catch up. 

You should give your tortoise a weekly supplement of calcium and D3. Use one specifically formulated for reptiles and simply sprinkle it onto a favourite food. Finally, always ensure your tortoise has access to fresh water by providing them with a bowl that they can climb into. They will drink by dipping their head under the water."

How should a 30 year old invest their money to enable them to retire by the time they're 65?,"Saving for retirement is an important topic for any individual or family to consider. 

In the US, most full-time employees are eligible for 401K or Roth IRA retirement savings programs through their employer, which enable you to defer taxes on your income and, in some cases, receive additional supplemental contributions up to a certain amount from your employer.

Through your 401K you often have access to a select range of what are call index funds, or mixes of securities that track specific groups of stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments. These can be actively managed, where a company or advisor controls the underlying investments in these funds, or passively managed, where the fund tracks a specific market or list of companies (example: XLF, a fund that tracks the broader banking industry). 

In terms of managing risk, generally you have a higher percentage of stocks vs. bonds or cash in your portfolio earlier in your career, with this mix shifting toward lower risk bonds as you get closer to retirement. Generally speaking, while actively managed funds do in some instances perform well, they are, on average, very similar in their performance to passively managed index funds and, due to their associated fees, most experts agree it's wise to focus on broad market index funds. 

A common retirement portfolio for a 30 year old might be comprised 50-75% of large capitalization domestic stock funds. It's typically wise to have some exposure to foreign markets and small/medium capitalization domestic stocks or specific market segments, with minimal bonds or cash until later in life."

How do I cook the best steak on the bbq?,"The best option for cooking a steak on the BBQ is to sear the steaks on the hottest part of the grill for a few minutes on each side, turning only once to form grill marks and then finishing the steaks on the cooler part of the grill for a few more minutes, until the desired doneness is reached. 

Here are the directions for the best results. You’ll want to remove steaks from the refrigerator 20 minutes before grilling and let sit, covered, at room temperature. During this time, preheat your grill on high. 

After 20 minutes, you’ll want to brush the steaks on both sides with oil and season liberally with salt and pepper, or your desired steak seasoning. 

Once the steaks and grill are both ready, you’ll place the steaks on the grill and cook until golden brown and slightly charred, which should take roughly 4 to 5 minutes. Turn the steaks and continue to grill for an additional 4 – 5 minutes for medium-rare, which has an internal temperature of 135 degrees Fahrenheit. For medium, you’ll grill for 5 to 7 minutes or 140 degrees Fahrenheit, or 8 to 10 minutes for medium-well at 150 degrees Fahrenheit. 

At the desired steak temperature, you will remove and transfer the steaks to a cutting board or platter, and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving."

Why some believe that continuous optimisation problems might be easier to solve than discrete optimisation problems?,"Some believe that continuous optimisation problems might be easier to solve than their discrete counterparts, owing to the smoothness of the objective functions, which allows the use of calculus techniques. In general, calculus techniques mean to use objective and constraint information at a particular point x, to deduce information about the behaviour of the objective function at all surrounding points close to x. The deduced information is then used to guide the search direction. In contrast, combinatorial optimisation problems are to some extent harder to solve than continuous ones. This is because the behaviour of the objective and constraints may change significantly as we move from one feasible point to another, even if the two points are close according to some measure. Thus it is usually not possible to deduce information about the neighbouring points from the current one."

What is the Taylor rule?,"The Taylor rule is a monetary policy targeting rule. The rule was proposed in 1992 by American economist John B. Taylor for central banks to use to stabilize economic activity by appropriately setting short-term interest rates. The rule considers the federal funds rate, the price level and changes in real income. The Taylor rule computes the optimal federal funds rate based on the gap between the desired (targeted) inflation rate and the actual inflation rate; and the output gap between the actual and natural output level. According to Taylor, monetary policy is stabilizing when the nominal interest rate is higher/lower than the increase/decrease in inflation. Thus the Taylor rule prescribes a relatively high interest rate when actual inflation is higher than the inflation target."

What are the types of space objects ?,"The International Astronomical Union (IAU) classifies objects in the Solar system into 3 categories :
1. Planet : a celestial body orbiting the Sun, with enough mass to assume a (nearly round) hydrostatic equilibrium shape, and that has ""cleared the neighbourhood"" around its orbit,
2. Dwarf planet : a celestial body orbiting the Sun, with enough mass to assume a (nearly round) hydrostatic equilibrium shape, but that has not ""cleared the neighbourhood"" around its orbit and is not a satellite,
3. Small Solar System Bodies : all other objects orbiting the sun that are not satellites.

Small Solar System Bodies of the Solar system include :
- Moons : celestial bodies that orbit a planet or a dwarf planet,
- Asteroids : rocky non-spherical left-over objects from the early formation of the Solar system. They travel around the sun and most of them are located within the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter,
- Comets : icy bodies that can also contain minerals, rocks and dust left over from the formation of the solar system. They travel around the sun and can be found mostly beyond Neptune in the Kuiper Belt, as well as far beyond Pluto in the Oort cloud,
- Meteoroids : objects in space that often come from other larger bodies such as comets, asteroids or even moons and planets. Meteoroids can be rocky, others can be metallic, or combinations of both. Their sizes range from dust grains to small asteroids."

Explain in few words how traditional exploratory data analysis (in statistics) is different from machine learning?,"An important general difference in the focus and purpose between machine learning and the traditional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is that machine learning is more oriented towards applications than explaining the basic nature of the underlying phenomena. Machine Learning is relatively less concerned with identifying the specific relations between the involved variables. For example, uncovering the nature of the underlying functions or the specific types of interactive, multivariate dependencies between variables are not the main goal of machine learning. Instead, the focus is on producing a solution that can generate useful predictions. Machine Learning accepts among others a ""black box"" type approach to data exploration or knowledge discovery and uses not only the traditional Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, but also such techniques as Neural Networks which can generate valid predictions but are not capable of identifying the specific nature of the interrelations between the variables on which the predictions are based."

Who is the greatest physicist of all time?,"There have been many great physicists over the years, and while it's not possible to say with certainty who was the 'greatest', Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are very strong contenders for that title.

Isaac Newton (1642-1746) was an English physicist and mathematician  most famous for inventing calculus, classical mechanics. His three laws of classical mechanics successfully predicted the behavior of solid bodies across all observable scales - from the motion of planets to falling apples. For over 250 years his laws were applied with greater and greater precision, always giving the correct answers.

However, in the late 1800s physicists struggled to reconcile measurements of the speed of light with Newton's laws. This one of the observations that led to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.

Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born physicist who revolutionized our understanding of space, time and matter with his theories of relativity and quantum mechanics. His theories of special and general relativity changed our understanding of space and time and successfully explained the motion of light and the behavior of gravity.  His theories of quantum mechanics likewise revolutionized our understand of the sub-atomic world.

In addition to Newton and Einstein there are many other physicists who made groundbreaking discoveries,  including Galileo Galilei, James Clerk Maxwell,  Marie Curie, Neils Bohr, Richard Feynman, and Stephen Hawking."

Many of these breeds were also intended to dig for their kills, so your dog may burrow because it's born to do that.  Said differently, some terrier breeds were meant to hunt rats, i.e. the rat terrier.  These dogs will dig even if there is nothing to dig for simply because it's what they were bred to do.  Other dogs dig to create nesting areas, to warm up their area before they lay down, or to check for bugs."

How do you increase your output on a Peloton ride?,"If you want to increase your output on a Peloton ride there are definitely a few tips and tricks to follow to ensure progress. First off, I would always recommend using the same official Peloton equipment (Peloton Bike or Peloton Bike+) to ensure you are tracking consistent metrics between your rides. I would also recommend doing a Functional Threshold Power Test (FTP Test), to get a baseline of your maximum performance as well as get a power meter for each of your rides. From there, a big amount of increasing your power comes from consistency of both riding frequency as well as consistency in overloading your leg muscles during those durations. Taking Power Zone rides (PZE, PZ, PZMax) or Power Zone programs is a great way to increase your output over time. These rides/programs are tailored to your max level of effort, and as you progress over time, so will your 7 power zone levels. Besides consistently riding and keeping track of your metrics/FTP, there is a quick trick for increasing your output which is not that sustainable. The trick is to ride out of the saddle and crank the resistance all the way up (75+). If you can move your legs at 50+ cadence and over say an 80 resistance, you will be putting up over 300 output. If you can sustain that for a minute at a time and do that 3-5 times during a ride, you will easily increase your total output. Lower cadence is not ideal for increasing your power from a longevity strategy, but is a quick answer for breaking a personal record. Good luck on your future rides, and don't forget to send love with some highfives!"

Set a clear agenda: At the beginning of the call, set a clear agenda for what you hope to accomplish during the call.

Ensure two-way conversation: Ask open-ended questions to encourage a dialogue and allow the prospect to share their thoughts and concerns.

Have a positive sign-off: At the end of the call, summarize the key points discussed and clarify any next steps or action items.

By conducting an effective discovery call, you can gather valuable information about the prospect and their needs, and begin to build a relationship of trust and understanding. This can lead to a more successful sales process and help you close more deals."
What is a plot hole?,"A plot hole is a plot point that happens in a fictional story, such as a movie, that contradicts the established logic of the story. For example, if a character is established as being extremely selfish, but in one scene he gives money to another character in need for no apparent reason, this would be a plot hole as this development would not make sense to a reasonable audience member.

Most plot holes can still be explained if someone tries hard enough, but if the story does not give enough clues for an audience member to easily understand what is going on, it is a plot hole.

Plot holes have different effects on different people. Some people are taken out of the story when they notice a plot hole. Others never notice it. Still others notice plot holes or learn of them afterwards, but do not mind the plot holes."
Tell me the history of Singapore,"Singapore was founded on 6 February 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles. Singapore started out as a British colony, where a free trading port was established for ships passing through the Malacca Straits. Singapore continued to thrive and became an important port globally which attracted many Chinese, Malay, Indian and Arab traders to operate in Singapore.

Singapore continued to prosper for many years until World War II. On 15 February 1942, the British surrendered to Japan and Singapore was renamed to Syonan-to. During the Japanese occupation, over 2500 lives were executed and many suffered hardships.

Post World War II, Singapore operated as a self-government led by Lee Kuan Yew, reducing its reliance on the British. During 1963 to 1965, Singapore had a merger with neighbouring country Malayisa. However, the merger brought about many disagreement, tensions and unrest. Eventually, Singapore separated from Malaysia and became a fully independent country on 9 August 1965."

What is the history of the Masters Golf Tournament,"The Masters was started by amateur champion Bobby Jones and investment banker Clifford Roberts. After his grand slam in 1930, Jones acquired the former plant nursery and co-designed Augusta National with course architect Alister MacKenzie. First played 89 years ago in 1934, the tournament is an official money event on the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.

The tournament has a number of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless they need to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Lee Elder, and Tom Watson. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.

Nicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. Tiger Woods won five between 1997 and 2019. Palmer won four between 1958 and 1964. Five have won three titles at Augusta: Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead, Gary Player, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson. Player, from South Africa, was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in 1961; the second was Seve Ballesteros of Spain, the champion in 1980 and 1983.

The Augusta National course first opened 90 years ago in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed."

When he arrived he ran into the assembly and shouted νενικήκαμεν (nenikēkamen, ""we have won!""). Then he collapsed and died.

"What does this mean: ""Steady-state theory""?","In cosmology, the steady-state model, or steady state theory, is an alternative to the Big Bang theory of the evolution of the universe. In the steady-state model, the density of matter in an expanding universe stays the same because matter is always being made. This fits with the perfect cosmological principle, which says that the universe we can see is pretty much the same everywhere and at any time. 

Problems with the steady-state model began to emerge in the 1950s and 60s, when observations began to support the idea that the universe was in fact changing: bright radio sources (quasars and radio galaxies) were found only at large distances (therefore could have existed only in the distant past due to the effects of the speed of light on astronomy), not in closer galaxies. 

The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964, which the Big Bang theory had predicted, provided the majority of cosmologists with a conclusive challenge to the steady-state model."

"What is ""woke"" and why is it so controversial?","Woke is a general political term used to group a set of similar ideologies in an attempt to characterize the political motivations typically ascribed to the far left. Although many definitions of woke exist, these definitions run along a few common threads. Woke is typically used to describe the ideals underpinning what is known as equality of outcome. This is to be contrasted with the opposing political forces who support equality of opportunity.

Those who engage in wokeness more often than not cite disparities as evidence of systemic biases or expressions of racism, sexism, classism, genderism, agism and other prejudices. A common example would be that females are disproportionately represented in elementary school teaching whereas males are disproportionately represented in railroad construction. Woke politics would lead us to believe that this is evidence of sexism: women and men are socialized differently so they are pushed into different positions by institutions. Woke opponents would lead us to believe this is evidence of inate preferences different between the sexes: males are generally stronger than females, so men are more suited to performing heavy labor.

Wokeness is controversial because its opponents do not believe disparity is evidence of bias. Disparities can exist due to natural or cultural differences, neither of which can be governed out of existence. The opponents of woke ideology also proclaim that it ignores the root cause of problems which plague society. If one's analysis stops at disparity and from disparity an answer is assumed, one can miss the nuances present in a situation. A common unavoidable disparity cited is that 100% of births are to females, but this is not sexism. Analysis past disparity is required to prove or disprove systemic or individual bias."
What is the difference between American football and European football?,"American football and European football are two different sports. American football, also known as gridiron, was first played in 1869 in the United States and mostly known in the United States and Canada. It rivals two teams on a rectangular field. Both teams have an offence as well as a defence formation. The first offence and defence of the match is decided by coin tossed where the winner decide for the first half of the match while the opposite match starts at the half-time mark. The offence team tries to take the oval-shaped ball to the other side of the field by passing or running it at each play. The defence team blocks the offence team so they get the balls themselves either by steeling it or when the offence team hasn’t progressed 10 yards in 4 plays. Then, offence team becomes defence and vice versa. When the offence team successfully reach the 10-yard lines, they obtain a new set of 4 plays to get to the endzone, where they obtain points when succeeding, called a touchdown. They also get points from kicking the ball within the goalpost. The winning team is the one with the most points at the end of the game. European football, also known as soccer, is a match between two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field, known as pitch. Players primarily use their feet to propel a sphere-shaped ball across the field into the rectangular shaped goal guarded by a goalkeeper. The goalkeeper is the only player of each team that can use his hands and arms on the ball within a specific region of the field close to their goals. The game is played continuously until a fault is committed or the ball exits the field. Each team tried and kick the ball in the goal to get points and the winner is the team with the most point at the end of the match."

Is it better to invest in the stock market or to keep money in a savings account?,"There are key differences between investing in the stock market versus keeping money in a savings account. Savings accounts can be FDIC insured up to $250k (although there are services that can increase this limit such as Wealthfront) and thus are extremely safe places to store money, but these accounts generally have very low interest rates and thus the money will not grow quickly (or at all, compared to inflation). Generally it is recommended to keep an emergency fund available in savings accounts as they may need to be quickly accessible. 

The stock market works differently - you are purchasing shares of a company, and ideally that company grows over time, thus increasing the value of the underlying stocks. People generally invest in the stock market in order to grow their money over time, although it is recommended to measure the success or failure of investments over a long time period (greater than 10 years). The broader US stock market has historically grown nearly 10%/year on average, although many years significantly deviate from that growth rate."

What do you think is the best Kanye album of all time?,"The best Kanye album of all time is a topic of extremely heated debate with many warring factions continuously in flux. 

The traditional school of thought places My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy at the #1 spot due to its redemption arc origins with Kanye composing it in Hawaii following his famous meltdown at the Grammys where he interrupted long time frenemy Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech to call out Beyonce as being robbed of the Best Music Video award.

There are however strong arguments for Kanye's original trilogy of releases from the start of his career with The College Dropout, Late Registration, and Graduation. Graduation being his first stadium album that really skyrocketed Kanye into the mainstream resulting in sold out tours and solidifying pop culture relevance. The fundamentalists fight for The College Dropout as it is a reflection of a simpler time and arguably his most honest and well produced album to date. The construction of this album was the subject of the Netflix 2022 documentary Jeen-yus.

At the end of the day, there is no right or wrong answer. Every person has a Kanye album that is their GOAT as it were. One cannot answer this question objectively. Such is life and the question itself reflects that journey so beautifully. Kanye albums are things you feel deep within your heart and resonate with you for a lifetime."

Like the related fields of scientific visualization and information visualization geovisualization emphasizes knowledge construction over knowledge storage or information transmission.[To do this, geovisualization communicates geospatial information in ways that, when combined with human understanding, allow for data exploration and decision-making processes.

Traditional, static maps have a limited exploratory capability; the graphical representations are inextricably linked to the geographical information beneath. GIS and geovisualization allow for more interactive maps; including the ability to explore different layers of the map, to zoom in or out, and to change the visual appearance of the map, usually on a computer display. Geovisualization represents a set of cartographic technologies and practices that take advantage of the ability of modern microprocessors to render changes to a map in real time, allowing users to adjust the mapped data on the fly."

What is nihilism and why do some people believe it? List some ways that philosophers have proposed to fight against nihilism. Explain to me in a casual tone,"Nihilism is a belief that life is ultimately meaningless. Sounds pretty depressing right? Well, there are a number of reasons why one might feel this way. Do you ever feel like you are just going through the motions each day? You wake up, go to work, get off work, sleep, and the cycle continues. You chased after a goal, such as graduating college or getting that next promotion, thinking it would solve all your problems, only to be disappointed after finally getting it. Then you look around the universe that you lives in and find how insignificant your individuality is in the grand schemes of things, you can't help but think to yourself: man, is there any point to life? Does what I do actually matter at all, especially if I'm going to die anyways? 

If you ever feel this way, know that you are not alone. Many, many philosophers throughout human history have pondered upon this very idea. I'll present a select few philosophers and their proposals to fight against nihilism.

One obvious solution, per Danish philosophers Kierkegaard, is religion. He believes that faith should be our purpose in life, following Him and doing good in this life will reap rewards in the afterlife. 

Now, German philosopher Nietzsche does not agree with that at all; in fact his most famous quote was ""God is dead and we killed him"". He's talking about how with new advances in science comes the death of religion -- each man must now create his own values and become an ubermensch. The idea of ubermensch, however, kind of throws morality out of window — who is to say one’s value is wrong?

Enter Albert Camus and his idea of absurdism. He compares human life to Sisyphus — rolling a giant rock uphill, only for the rock to fall back down after reaching the top — an absurd and meaningless struggle. He suggests that we accept the absurdity of this world and human existence, and instead embrace the present, because “The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy”.

And there you have it, what nihilism is all about, why it happens and a few ways to fight against it. Note that this is a very extensive topic and what I covered here is only the tip of the iceberg, I’d suggest reading up more if you're interested. Hope it helped!"

What is a mitochondrion?,"A mitochondrion is an organelle found in the cells of most eukaryotes, such as animals, plants and fungi. Mitochondria have a double membrane structure and use aerobic respiration to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used throughout the cell as a source of chemical energy. They were discovered by Albert von Kölliker in 1857  in the voluntary muscles of insects. The term mitochondrion was coined by Carl Benda in 1898. The mitochondrion is popularly nicknamed the ""powerhouse of the cell"", a phrase coined by Philip Siekevitz in a 1957 article of the same name.

Some cells in some multicellular organisms lack mitochondria (for example, mature mammalian red blood cells). A large number of unicellular organisms, such as microsporidia, parabasalids and diplomonads, have reduced or transformed their mitochondria into other structures. One eukaryote, Monocercomonoides, is known to have completely lost its mitochondria, and one multicellular organism, Henneguya salminicola, is known to have retained mitochondrion-related organelles in association with a complete loss of their mitochondrial genome.

Mitochondria are commonly between 0.75 and 3 μm2 in cross section, but vary considerably in size and structure. Unless specifically stained, they are not visible. In addition to supplying cellular energy, mitochondria are involved in other tasks, such as signaling, cellular differentiation, and cell death, as well as maintaining control of the cell cycle and cell growth. Mitochondrial biogenesis is in turn temporally coordinated with these cellular processes. Mitochondria have been implicated in several human disorders and conditions, such as mitochondrial diseases, cardiac dysfunction, heart failure and autism.

The number of mitochondria in a cell can vary widely by organism, tissue, and cell type. A mature red blood cell has no mitochondria, whereas a liver cell can have more than 2000. The mitochondrion is composed of compartments that carry out specialized functions. These compartments or regions include the outer membrane, intermembrane space, inner membrane, cristae, and matrix.

Although most of a eukaryotic cell's DNA is contained in the cell nucleus, the mitochondrion has its own genome (""mitogenome"") that is substantially similar to bacterial genomes. This finding has led to general acceptance of the endosymbiotic hypothesis - that free-living prokaryotic ancestors of modern mitochondria permanently fused with eukaryotic cells in the distant past, evolving such that modern animals, plants, fungi, and other eukaryotes are able to respire to generate cellular energy."

What causes leaves to change color in fall,"Leaves are green due to the presence of chlorophyll. During the spring and summer months when trees are growing, there's an abundance of chlorophyll pigments in the leaves. 

Chlorophyll serves the vital function of capturing sun rays and converting it to energy for the plants i.e, plants food & source of nourishment. In late summer, early fall as the days shorten there's less solar energy and thus Chlorophyll starts to breakdown giving way for other pigments such as Carotenoids to become more obvious and there orange-yellow-red colors to surface giving the trees the famous ""fall color"" look"

What is insurance?,"Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss in which, in exchange for a fee, a party agrees to compensate another party in the event of a certain loss, damage, or injury. It is a form of risk management, primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.

An entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance carrier, or underwriter. A person or entity who buys insurance is known as a policyholder, while a person or entity covered under the policy is called an insured. The insurance transaction involves the policyholder assuming a guaranteed, known, and relatively small loss in the form of a payment to the insurer (a premium) in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss. The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms. Furthermore, it usually involves something in which the insured has an insurable interest established by ownership, possession, or pre-existing relationship."

How does interest rates and inflation impact bond prices?,"Interest rates have an inverse effect on bond prices. Typically as the interest rate go up, the existing bonds that were sold previously at a certain maturity and coupon, now stands devalued as investors can get a newer bond for higher interest payments.  Similarly during inflation as Fed tries to control inflation by raising interest rates it has the inverse effect on bond prices. It is important to note that not all bonds react the same way to interest rates. For example, short term interest rate bonds may feel the impact almost immediately while long term bonds may have a gradual but likely to see more impactful price change. It is important to note that there are Treasury Inflation protected securities, a type of a bond that adjust principal value of the bond based on inflation."

Can you please explain the offside rule in Soccer?,"Soccer is a sport played between two teams with 11 players each. Out of the 11 players one is a goalkeeper. The offside rule is fundamental in soccer to avoid players from gaining unfair advantage over the opposition. A player is in an offside position if they are closer to the opposition's goal line than the last defender of the opposition team. 

The law states that a player is in an offside position if any of their body parts, except the hands and arms, are in the opponents' half of the pitch, and closer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last defender.

Being in an offside position is not an offence in itself, but a player so positioned when the ball is played by a teammate can be judged guilty of an offside offence if they receive the ball or will otherwise become ""involved in active play"", will ""interfere with an opponent"", or will ""gain an advantage"" by being in that position. Offside is often considered one of the most difficult to understand aspects of the sport."

Racquetball is played in an enclosed room where players hit the ball back and forth against the same wall. In tennis, players also hit the ball back and forth but they hit it to each other over a net. In tennis, the ball has a fuzzy outer layer which causes the ball's trajectory to be more influenced by the spin on the ball. The rackets in tennis are larger and have higher tension.

A tennis court is much larger than a racquetball court measuring 78 ft long and 36 ft wide. This width is reduced in tennis to 27 ft for a singles match.

These are just a few of the differences but there are many more: scoring, attire, court markings, etc."

Usually for sales/services transactions it is a fee that a merchant's bank (the ""acquiring bank"") pays a customer's bank (the ""issuing bank"").

In a credit card or debit card transaction, the card-issuing bank in a payment transaction deducts the interchange fee from the amount it pays the acquiring bank that handles a credit or debit card transaction for a merchant. The acquiring bank then pays the merchant the amount of the transaction minus both the interchange fee and an additional, usually smaller, fee for the acquiring bank or independent sales organization (ISO), which is often referred to as a discount rate, an add-on rate, or passthru. For cash withdrawal transactions at ATMs, however, the fees are paid by the card-issuing bank to the acquiring bank (for the maintenance of the machine)."

What should I do if water is dripping from the ceiling inside my house?,"The first task is to figure out if the leak is coming from inside of your pipes or from external moisture like rain.  If the leak only happens when it is raining, then shut off the main water supply and see if the leak still happens.  If yes, then it is likely from rain.  If it has been sunny and dry for a week and you are still getting the leak, shut the water off and see if the leak stops.  If it does, then that is likely from an internal leak.  If it is in fact an internal leak, then call a reputable local plumber to have them test your pipes for pressure loss.  If it is an external leak, then wait for sunny weather.  After about a week of dry sunny weather, get a garden hose and pick a feature of your roof or external walls and spray that feature (vent pipe, window, roof juncture, etc) with a direct stream of high volume and low velocity water from the garden hose.  Wait for a few hours, and see if the leak appears.  After four hours, if no leak has appeared, then move on to the next feature.  If hosing down a specific feature does in fact cause dripping within that four hour window, then either call a roof repair company or go to your local hardware store and talk to an expert about ways to seal cracks or gaps in siding or roofing material."

However, whether an alternative hypothesis with a p-value of less than 0.05 should be accepted without providing further evidence is controversial. Therefore, to properly quantify the statistical significance of results, contextual factors must also be considered, such as the quality of the measurements, the external evidence, and the validity of the assumptions underlying the data analysis."

"""Big Bang"": what does it mean?","The Big Bang theory, which is how astronomers explain the origin of the universe, holds that the universe as we know it began billions of years ago in a huge explosion. At the time of this explosion, all the matter that exists in the universe today was concentrated at one point.

From the moment of the explosion, matter began to expand and is still expanding today. That is why the Big Bang theory includes the theory of the expanding universe. In addition to expanding, matter began to form more complex structures, from atoms and molecules to the living organisms we know today.

The name ""Big Bang"" was first used by physicist Fred Hoyle in 1949, who disagreed with this theory, preferring the steady-state model of the universe.  The idea of a big bang seemed absurd to Hoyle."

It is a variant of white wine where the skin grapes are not removed after crushing the grapes. Instead, the skins are left to ferment with the grape juice, similarly to red wine. The style of skin-contact white wine was adopted by Italian and Slovenian winemakers, after visiting Georgia. It then spread to other European countries. 

Skin-fermented white wines were common up until the 1960s, when fresh white wines started to dominate the market.

The term orange wine was coined only in 2004 by a British wine importer.

In Georgia skin-contact white wine is historically known as amber wine."

Why are dogs called dogs?,"About seven centuries ago, the word hound, which came from the Old English hund, was the word for all domestic canines. Dog was just used to refer to a subgroup of hounds that includes the lovely but frequently slobbering mastiff.

Of course, the opposite is now true. We use dog to talk about all of man’s best friends, from lovable golden retrievers to panting chow chows. And hound is now used to indicate a type of dog used just for hunting. Hound especially refers to a dog with a long face and large, droopy ears. Linguists still speculate about the reversal of fortune for hound and dog. One idea suggests that the sub-breed known as dogs became so populous that dog simply became the generic term (sort of an animal equivalent of the way brand names can become so ubiquitous that they start to be used as a general term for their purpose)."

What is the major source of income in Ethiopia and why its important?,"Agriculture is the backbone of the economy and the main source of livelihood for the majority of the population. However, traditional agricultural practices have led to soil degradation and deforestation. Farmers in Ethiopia often rely on a few staple crops, such as teff, wheat, and maize, which are grown repeatedly on the same plot of land without proper rotation or replenishment of soil nutrients (International Labour Organization). This leads to reduced yields, which can make it difficult for farmers to produce enough food to feed their families and earn a living. Deforestation, which is also a major problem, has been driven by the need for more land to grow crops. Ethiopia has one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, with an estimated loss of 1.1 million hectares of forest every year (World Bank)."

Define Part of Speech,"In grammar, a part of speech or part-of-speech (abbreviated as POS or PoS, also known as word class or grammatical category) is a category of words (or, more generally, of lexical items) that have similar grammatical properties. Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar syntactic behavior (they play similar roles within the grammatical structure of sentences), sometimes similar morphological behavior in that they undergo inflection for similar properties and even similar semantic behavior. Commonly listed English parts of speech are noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, interjection, numeral, article, and determiner.

Almost all languages have the word classes noun and verb, but beyond these two there are significant variations among different languages. For example:

Japanese has as many as three classes of adjectives, where English has one.
Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese have a class of nominal classifiers.
Many languages do not distinguish between adjectives and adverbs, or between adjectives and verbs.
Because of such variation in the number of categories and their identifying properties, analysis of parts of speech must be done for each individual language. Nevertheless, the labels for each category are assigned on the basis of universal criteria"

What is an aurora?,"An aurora, also commonly known as the polar lights, is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.

Auroras are the result of disturbances in the magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionisation and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles."

Please provide some resources that will help me think through the process of creating an online course.,"First, determine what type of course you want to teach. A common technique that you might use to identify a suitable course is: Find a topic you are knowledgeable about, find a topic that you are passionate about, and find a topic that others are interested in and willing to pay for. If you have a topic that overlaps all three areas, then you have a good topic for a course.

Once you have a topic identified, there are numerous resources you can consult. Course-hosting platforms like Thinkific, Kajabi, and Podia have helpful information about creating an online course. Other ways to learn are podcasts like My First Million, Creator Science, and the Online Course Show."

How are odds different from probability?,"Both are measurements for how likely it is for an event to occur. Odds are commonly used in gambling, which probability is a measure that is commonly used in mathematics/statistics. In statistics, probability measures the number of outcomes in which a particular event occurred divided by the total number of possible outcomes. For example, the probability of rain on a given day would be based on, historically with similar conditions, the number of rainy days divided by a total number of days. The odds are measured as the number of events divided by the number of non-events. To contrast, probability would be the number of events divided by the sum of events and non-events."
Is it wrong to split the infinitive?,"First, let's establish the meaning of a split infinitive. In simple terms the infinitive is the grammatical construct in which a verb is preceded by the word 'to': hence, 'to walk', 'to talk', 'to reason'. As a side-note, it's probably worth exploring whether the 'verbification' of nouns is a good thing: personally, I take issue with this and feel that examples such as 'to medal', meaning 'to win a medal at a sporting event', should never have been visited on the English language. But that's another discussion entirely. Returning to the infinitive, the split occurs when another word (usually an adverb) is placed between the word 'to' and its corresponding verb. Probably the most famous split infinitive occurs in the opening sequence of every episode of the classic and original TV show, Star Trek, with the lines:
""Space: The final frontier
These are the voyages of the Starship, Enterprise;
Its five year mission:
to explore strange new worlds;
to seek out new life and new civilizations;
to boldly go where no man has gone before.""
Note that final line: 'to boldly go'. Never has an infinitive been split so boldly before or since. Those who are grammatical pedants will have shuddered at this every time (and probably ended up preferring Star Wars to Star Trek as a consequence) but through those original seventy-nine episodes and their many repeat showings, the split infinitive has subtly embedded itself in our lexicon. 
So, to return to the question, is it wrong to split the infinitive? Since language is constantly evolving, influenced by the whims and practices of each generation, the answer must be 'no'. On the whole sentences tend to flow more freely and with greater elan if infinitives aren't split and pesky adverbs are kept in their place either before or after ('to go boldly' or 'boldly to go') but sometimes one has to admit that splitting works, and we should be thankful for the colour that brings to the language we hear daily. Who nowadays wouldn't want to boldly go?"

The FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) is responsible for issuing Authorizations to Operate (ATO) for cloud service providers."
Who are the best chess players of all time?,"It's difficult to determine who the best chess players of all time are as there are a variety of factors to consider when determining chess strength. For example, you might consider things like chess rating, number of tournament wins, time spent as world chess champion, etc. It's especially difficult to compare players of different eras, as more modern chess players will have learned from past Grandmasters and have more advanced technology available to facilitate their understanding of the game.

Three chess players commonly discussed as possibly being the best of all time include: Bobby Fischer, Gary Kasparov, and Magnus Carlsen. Bobby Fischer is well-known for winning the ""Game of the Century"" at the age of 13 and, as an adult, won 20 consecutive games against some of the best chess players in the world. Gary Kasparov was the number one rated chess player for over 20 years and was World Chess Champion for 15 consecutive years. Magnus Carlsen achieved the highest chess rating ever in 2014 with a rating of 2882 and has been the number one rated chess player since 2011."

What is retail banking?,"Retail banking, also known as consumer banking or personal banking, is the provision of services by a bank to the general public, rather than to companies, corporations or other banks, which are often described as wholesale banking. Banking services which are regarded as retail include provision of savings and transactional accounts, mortgages, personal loans, debit cards, and credit cards. Retail banking is also distinguished from investment banking or commercial banking. It may also refer to a division or department of a bank which deals with individual customers.

In the U.S., the term commercial bank is used for a normal bank to distinguish it from an investment bank. After the Great Depression, the Glass–Steagall Act restricted normal banks to banking activities, and investment banks to capital market activities. That distinction was repealed in the 1990s. Commercial bank can also refer to a bank or a division of a bank that deals mostly with deposits and loans from corporations or large businesses, as opposed to individual members of the public (retail banking)."

What is the source or cause of the Sun’s light?,Much like other stars the Sun is powered by nuclear reactions. The process of nuclear fusion takes place in the Sun’s core. The intense pressure and temperature at the core causes nuclear fusion - in this case hydrogen atoms fusing to create helium this process releases energy. The energy is emitted as gamma rays which travel slowly from the Sun’s core to the outer region. During the rise to the surface gamma rays collide with electrons degrading in temperature and energy to finally emerge  as visible radiation - this is the light Sun produces.

Please provide a brief history of coffee,"The history of coffee dates back to centuries of old oral tradition in modern day Ethiopia. However, neither where coffee was first cultivated nor direct evidence of its consumption prior to the 15th century have been found. Sufi monasteries in Yemen employed coffee as an aid to concentration during prayers. Coffee later spread to the Levant and Persia in the early 16th century; it caused some controversy on whether it was halal in Ottoman and Mamluk society. Coffee arrived in Italy the second half of the 16th century through commercial Mediterranean trade routes, while Central and Eastern Europeans learnt of coffee from the Ottomans. By the mid 17th century, it had reached India and the East Indies. Coffee houses would establish themselves in Western Europe by the late 17th century, especially in England and Germany. One of the earliest cultivations of coffee in the New World was when Gabriel de Clieu brought coffee seedlings to Martinique in 1720. These beans later sprouted 18,680 coffee trees which enabled its spread to other Caribbean islands like Saint-Domingue and also to Mexico. By 1788, Saint-Domingue supplied half the world's coffee. By 1852, globally, Brazil became the largest producer of coffee and has held that status ever since. The period since 1950 saw the widening of the playing field due to the emergence of several other major producers, notably Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, and Vietnam; the latter overtook Colombia and became the second-largest producer in 1999. Modern production techniques along with the mass productization of coffee has made it a household item today."

Why does the US Federal Reserve raise interest rates?,"One of the primary roles of the US Federal Reserve is to control the supply of money within the economy.  During times when the economy is doing incredibly well, a.k.a. running hot or facing inflation (rise of prices of goods and services), the Federal Reserve will need to reduce the supply of money by increasing the cost of borrowing.  

The primary lever to increase the cost of borrowing is by increasing the Federal Funds rate (the rate for banks to borrow and lend their excess reserves to meet liquidity requirements). Increasing the Federal Funds rate results in more expensive borrowing costs, which can reduce demand among banks to borrow money.  Less money is borrowed to help fund the economy resulting in a reduction in purchasing power and the money supply.  This will slow down the pace of economic growth and help ease inflation."

Give me an example of a screened subnet,"In network security a screened subnet refers to the use of one or more logical screening routers as a firewall to define three separate subnets: an external router (sometimes called an access router), that separates the external network from a perimeter network, and an internal router (sometimes called a choke router) that separates the perimeter network from the internal network. The perimeter network, also called a border network or demilitarized zone (DMZ), is intended for hosting servers (sometimes called bastion hosts) that are accessible from or have access to both the internal and external networks. The purpose of a screened subnet or DMZ is to establish a network with heightened security that is situated between an external and presumed hostile network, such as the Internet or an extranet, and an internal network.

A screened subnet is an essential concept for e-commerce or any entity that has a presence in the World Wide Web or is using electronic payment systems or other network services because of the prevalence of hackers, advanced persistent threats, computer worms, botnets, and other threats to networked information systems."

Who bench pressed his way to pure bliss
When the plates started flying
He was never seen crying 
Until a time of great peril made him miss
As he lay under barbell, covered in sweat
he peered at a creature in diss
this was but a danger, which tended to linger
in the dungeons of temples of lift
Next thing you know, Chris awoke with a blow
to his head and his heart but to this
He exclaimed it was: ""nothing to worry""
Though the damage was done
It had never been fun
To this point life could only be bliss"

Compare middle eastern music and western music,"If you have only listened to Western music, the first time you hear o a middle eastern melody it may sound very different and odd. Melodies in middle eastern music are generally long, lack harmony, and have unfamiliar pitches.

Middle Eastern music typically sounds monophonic, meaning it's solely based on one or more instruments that play a single melody with a different variation. Western music typically sounds polyphonic, meaning more than one layer of melody is being played simultaneously.

Western music has twelve notes per octave including seven whole notes and five half-notes. However middle eastern music is based on different scale systems. It has quarter notes in addition and various regions have a different number of notes in their octave system.

Western music has harmony (ie. chords) while middle eastern music does not. In middle eastern music, there is only one melodic line with rise and fall. So the purity of the melodic line and the complexity of the rhythm is what make two different songs apart. In contrast, western music has a structure with a beginning, middle, and end."

What is the English football league system?,"The English football league system, also known as the football pyramid, is a series of interconnected leagues for men's association football clubs in England, with five teams from Wales, one from Guernsey, one from Jersey and one from the Isle of Man also competing. The system has a hierarchical format with promotion and relegation between leagues at different levels, allowing even the smallest club the theoretical possibility of ultimately rising to the very top of the system, the Premier League. Below that are levels 2–4 organised by the English Football League, then the National League System from levels 5–10 administered by the FA, and thereafter feeder leagues run by relevant county FAs on an ad hoc basis.

The exact number of clubs varies from year to year as clubs join and leave leagues, merge, or fold altogether, but an estimated average of 15 clubs per division implies that more than 7,000 teams of nearly 5,300 clubs are members of a league in the English men's football league system.

As there are no official definitions of any level below 11, any references to the structure at level 12 and below should not be regarded as definitive.

The pyramid for women's football in England runs separately into ten tiers, and some England-based men's clubs play outside the English football league system."

Settlement in ""real time"" means a payment transaction is not subjected to any waiting period, with transactions being settled as soon as they are processed. ""Gross settlement"" means the transaction is settled on a one-to-one basis, without bundling or netting with any other transaction. ""Settlement"" means that once processed, payments are final and irrevocable.

RTGS systems are usually operated by a country's central bank as it is seen as critical infrastructure for a country's economy. Economists believe that an efficient national payment system reduces the cost of exchanging goods and services, and is indispensable to the functioning of the interbank, money, and capital markets. A weak payment system may severely drag on the stability and developmental capacity of a national economy; its failures can result in inefficient use of financial resources, inequitable risk-sharing among agents, actual losses for participants, and loss of confidence in the financial system and in the very use of money."

What is molecular biology?,"Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including biomolecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.[ The study of chemical and physical structure of biological macromolecules is known as molecular biology.

Molecular biology was first described as an approach focused on the underpinnings of biological phenomena - uncovering the structures of biological molecules as well as their interactions, and how these interactions explain observations of classical biology.

In 1945 the term molecular biology was used by physicist William Astbury. In 1953 Francis Crick, James Watson, Rosalind Franklin, and colleagues, working at Medical Research Council unit, Cavendish laboratory, Cambridge (now the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology), made a double helix model of DNA which changed the entire research scenario. They proposed the DNA structure based on previous research done by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. This research then lead to finding DNA material in other microorganisms, plants and animals.

Molecular biology is not simply the study of biological molecules and their interactions; rather, it is also a collection of techniques developed since the field's genesis which have enabled scientists to learn about molecular processes. In this way it has both complemented and improved biochemistry and genetics as methods (of understanding nature) that began before its advent. One notable technique which has revolutionized the field is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was developed in 1983. PCR is a reaction which amplifies small quantities of DNA, and it is used in many applications across scientific disciplines.

The central dogma of molecular biology describes the process in which DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into protein.

Molecular biology also plays a critical role in the understanding of structures, functions, and internal controls within individual cells, all of which can be used to efficiently target new drugs, diagnose disease, and better understand cell physiology. Some clinical research and medical therapies arising from molecular biology are covered under gene therapy whereas the use of molecular biology or molecular cell biology in medicine is now referred to as molecular medicine."

What is a dig in baseball?,"A ""dig"" or ""digging one out"" is an expression to describe a defensive player accepting a baseball with a motion that captures the ball very near the ground.  This kind of expression is often, though not always, used to describe a first baseman catching a ball thrown by another player that bounces before it reaches them as they hold one foot on first base.  This expression can also be used to describe another fielder, typically an infielder, to get a ball into their glove or hand that bounced near them or immediately before reaching them."
"What are ""VTubers""?","VTubers are short for ""Virtual Youtubers"". The first VTuber was ""Kizuna AI"", who was using a 3D avatar and acted in various funny short videos and claimed to be a ""Super AI"". In reality Kizuna AI was acted by Kasuga Nozomi, an voice actor, who also later revealed her identity in the Kizuna API project. The debut of Kizuna AI prompted more people to become VTubers, and there began a whole industry from drawing avatars (mostly anime characters), to making 2D (called Live2D) and 3D models, to companies that recruit and support talents that act as ""VTubers"". The VTuber industry boomed as the live streaming industry gained momentum, and in many cases, streamers find it more relaxing to use an avatar rather than showing their real faces, bringing in a new generation of streamers into the industry. Right now, some of the most famous female streamers are virtual youtubers, such as Gawr Gura from Hololive Productions."
Do humans have stripes?,"Humans have ""stripes"" called Blaschko's lines.

Who was Charles Guillaume Loys de Bochat,"Charles Guillaume Loys de Bochat (born 11 December 1695 in Lausanne, died 4 April 1754, also in Lausanne) was an 18th-century Swiss jurist and antiquarian (Lausanne at the time was a subject territory controlled by Berne).

He studied theology in Basle, which he interrupted for health reasons, and later changed his subject to law, in which he graduated in 1717. He became professor of law in Lausanne in 1718, but he was granted leave to travel for three years, which he spent in Halle, in Leyden and in France.

From 1721, he taught law at the Lausanne Academy, where he acted as rector from 1727 to 1730. In 1738, he proposed to transform the academy into a full university, without success.

Loys de Bochat is best known for his major work, Mémoires critiques pour servir d'Eclaircissemens sur divers points de l'Histoire ancienne de la Suisse, which appeared in three volumes in 1747-1749.

What makes the banded bullfrog special,"The banded bullfrog (Kaloula pulchra) is a species of frog in the narrow-mouthed frog family Microhylidae. Native to Southeast Asia, it is also known as the Asian painted frog, digging frog, Malaysian bullfrog, common Asian frog, and painted balloon frog. In the pet trade, it is sometimes called the chubby frog. Adults measure 5.4 to 7.5 cm (2.1 to 3.0 in) and have a dark brown back with stripes that vary from copper-brown to salmon pink.

The banded bullfrog lives at low altitudes and is found in both urban and rural settings, as well as in forest habitats. They bury themselves underground during dry periods and emerge after heavy rainfall to emit calls and breed. They feed primarily on ants and termites; predators of adults and tadpoles include snakes, dragonfly larvae, and snails. When threatened, they inflate their lungs and secrete a noxious white substance. The species is prevalent in the pet trade and is a potential invasive species being introduced in Taiwan, the Philippines, Guam, Singapore, Borneo, and Sulawesi."

What are the advantages and disadvantages of learning Java over Python?,"Java and Python are two of the most popular programming languages. Of the two, Java is the faster language, but Python is simpler and easier to learn. Each is well-established, platform-independent, and part of a large, supportive community. But that is where the similarities end. When you’re considering Python versus Java, each language has different uses for different purposes, and each has pros and cons to consider.

Advantages of Java

Speed and efficiency are two of the big draws of using Java. It's also one of the coding languages considered to be easy to learn. Because many of the processes of this high-level language run automatically, you won't have to do an intense study of how everything works as much as you would with a low-level language. You should be able to master it relatively quickly depending on how much time you can devote to learning and practicing. Other advantages of using Java include the following:

(1) It's simple: The syntax is straightforward, making it easy to write. It's not as complex as languages like C++, and it uses automatic memory allocation.

(2) It’s platform independent: You can use Java on multiple types of computers, including Windows, iOS, Unix, and Linux systems, as long as it has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform.

(3) It’s object oriented: Because you create classes containing data and functions and objects that belong to those classes, it offers a more intuitive approach for big project development. It also provides flexibility and easier troubleshooting, and the ability to reuse the code.

(4) It has a large global community: This is helpful when you're learning Java or should you run into any problems.

(5) It supports multithreading: When you use Java, you can run more than one thread at a time. When running multiple threads, they share a common memory area to increase efficiency and performance.

(6) It’s secure: Java avoids using explicit pointers, runs inside a virtual machine called a sandbox, uses byte-code verifier to check for illegal code, and provides library-level safety along with Java security package and run-time security checks. 

Disadvantages of Java

Before deciding whether Java is the right programming language for you to start with, it’s essential to consider its weaknesses. One of the main downsides to using Java is that it uses a large amount of memory—considerably more than Python.

Additionally, Java manages its memory through garbage collection, which happens once the application you’re working on no longer references the object. Java’s garbage collector clears it from memory, but during the process, other threads have to stop while the garbage collector works. The step impacts the overall performance of the application. Other disadvantages include:

(1) It doesn’t offer control over garbage collection: As a programmer, you won’t have the ability to control garbage collection using functions like free() or delete().

(2) It has a lot of words: Although Java is simple, it does tend to have a lot of words in it, which will often leave you with complex, lengthy sentences and explanations.

(3) It doesn't have a native look when you use it for desktops: Java has multiple graphical user interface (GUI) builders, but they aren't the best if you're creating complex UI on a desktop. Java is weaker when you're using it for desktop versus mobile when it comes to user experience and user interface. While there are many GUI builders to choose from, you'll need to do a lot of research to find the right one for your project.


Python: The simple path

Although Java is faster, Python is more versatile, easier to read, and has a simpler syntax. According to Stack Overflow, this general use, interpreted language is the fourth most popular coding language.  It's also one of the most in-demand programming languages that hiring managers look for when hiring candidates, according to HackerRank, second only to JavaScript. 

Python's popularity has experienced explosive growth in the past few years, with more than 11.3 million coders choosing to use it, mainly for IoT, data science, and machine learning applications, according to ZDNet. Further, Python has had a 25 percent growth rate, adding 2.3 million developers to its community between Q3 2020 and Q3 2021, according to SlashData's “State of the Developer Nation.”.

Advantages of Python

Python’s versatility is difficult to match, and it's so flexible that it encourages experimentation. This keeps programmers from being pigeonholed into only building one type of application. You can learn just one language and use it to make new and different things.

Computer Weekly calls Python the most versatile programming language, noting that “Although there might be a better solution for any given problem, Python will always get the job done well”. Other advantages of Python include:

(1) It’s platform-independent: Like Java, you can use Python on various platforms, including macOS, Windows, and Linux. You’ll just need an interpreter designed for that platform.

(2) It allows for fast development: Because Python is dynamically typed, it's fast and friendly for development. Additionally, it uses asynchronous code to tackle situations and challenges faster because each unit of code runs separately.

(3) It offers extensive libraries: Its large library supports common tasks and commands. It also contains code that can be used for many different purposes, ranging from generating documentation to unit testing to CGI.

(4) It offers a more flexible approach to programming: Python supports a variety of programming styles and has multiple paradigms. Not only is this optimal for programmers who enjoy flexibility, but it also makes it ideal for start-ups that might need to shift approaches abruptly.

(5) It's free and open-source: You can download Python without any cost, and because it's so easy to learn and boasts one of the largest and most active communities—you should be able to start writing code in mere minutes.

(6) It may boost productivity: NetGuru says that Python is more productive than Java because of how concise it is and because it's dynamically typed. Additionally, it has control capabilities and integration features that can make applications more productive.

Disadvantages of Python

While Python is arguably one of the easiest and fastest languages to learn, it’s also decidedly slower to execute because it’s a dynamically typed, interpreted language, executed line-by-line. Python does extra work while executing the code, making it less suitable for use in projects that depend on speed. However, if speed isn’t a sensitive issue, Python’s slower nature won’t likely be a problem.

Other potential disadvantages include:

(1) It only executes one thread at a time: Python has a Global Interpreter Lock that only lets one thread execute at a time, so if you're working on a multi-threaded CPU-bound program, it'll likely be even slower. Using multiprocessing programs instead of multithreaded programs can be an effective workaround.

(2) It isn't mobile native: Python can be effectively and easily used for mobile purposes, but you'll need to put a bit more effort into finding libraries that give you the necessary framework. Some examples include Kivy, which lets you use the same API to create mobile apps and software that you can run on Raspberry PI, Linux, and Windows.

(3) It uses a large amount of memory: If you're working on a project where many objects are active in RAM, this could present an issue for you. Switching to NumPy could be an effective workaround to reduce the amount of memory Python uses for each object."

What is John Ellis water and the bond angle of water?,"Traditional tap and purified water has a hydrogen bond angle of 104 - 104.5 degrees.  John Ellis water takes standard tap or purified water and changes the hydrogen bond angle of it from 104 degrees to 113 - 114 degrees.  Changing the bond angle is done using multi-pass distillation by rapidly heating and cooling the water inside the boiling chamber.

Water consumed with a bond angle above 108° degrees eliminates the effect of potential pathogens in our food supply (e.g. bacterium, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) from affecting our bodies because more oxygen from the water mixes with the superior blood flow to all the extremities of our body.  The larger bond angle enables our bodies to use more of the oxygen present in the water."

Rugby is most popular in commonwealth nations however has been gaining popularity in other countries such as USA and Japan. The game is played in two 40 minute halves with the winner of the game ending up with the most points. Points can be earned by grounding the ball over the try line in the other teams territory or by kicking the ball through the posts on either end of the field. The game is notorious for its aggression and tackling which can result in injuries as the players don't wear helmets or body armour like in other sports."

What planning should you do to visit Walt Disney World?,"You should start planning your Walt Disney World vacation at least six months in advance.  First figure out your travel arrangements.  If you are able to drive, you will have your own vehicle available to travel to the parks.  If you fly, you will either need a rental car or will need to use other forms of transportation, such as uber or lyft.  Within the Walt Disney World parks and resorts there is Disney provided transportation, but it is often crowded during peak hours such as park opening and closing.  Next you will need to decide where to stay.  The Walt Disney World resorts are the most convenient, but also the most expensive option.  There are Walt Disney World resorts cater to different economic levels from more affordable up to more luxurious.  Staying on the grounds will also often allow to enter parks earlier or stay later than the general public.  Staying off the grounds is usually less expensive.  There are many hotels and resorts in the Orlando area to choose from.  Other options are to use a rental service such as VRBO or AirBnB to rent a property such as a house or condo for your stay.  Next you need to decide on how many days in the parks you'll spend and whether you will stay in one park for an entire day or want to have the option to ""park hop"".  Tickets are discounted for a larger number of days in the park.  The ""park hopper"" option is a premium on top of the base ticket price.  Often there are discount ticket websites but be careful about scams.  The safest is to buy from Disney or a licensed travel advisor.  Typically the price from a travel advisor is they same as buying from Disney.  Next make a budget for how much you'll spend on food in the parks.  Food is fairly pricy, but there are options from counter service all the way up to sit down restaurants and fine dining.  Realize that eating in a sit down restaurant will take time away from other activities in the parks.  Reservations can be made on the Disney website but are often difficult to get for some restaurants.  Taking food into the park is also an option as there are lockers available at the parks to store things.  Some items such as knives are not allowed, so plan ahead if food needs to be sliced.  Next look at the rides and attractions that your family wants to ride and make a plan for which are the most important.  A guidebook such as the Unauthorized Guide to Disney World is very helpful to provide plans for your day(s) in the parks.  These guidebooks will give you help on when the lines for attractions will be shorter.  Don't just try to show up in a park without some sort of plan as to which attractions to visit and when.  Visiting without a plan will result in frustration, long waits, and disappointment.  Also realize that you will not be able to visit all of the park attractions in one visit.  As the time of your visit approaches watch the weather reports.  Late afternoon thunderstorms are typical in Orlando in the summertime.  Most attractions at Disney World are indoors and will continue operating during rain.  Rain ponchos can be purchased in the park, but they are more expensive in park than if you bring your own.  It can also be very hot during the summer, so plan on having water, sunscreen and wearing appropriate clothing for the weather.  Be aware of how your party's attitude is during your visit.  Visiting Disney World requires a lot of walking and also requires stamina.  If people are getting tired, take a break, either in the park or back at your hotel.  Don't make your visit a ""death march"".  Also base the length of your stay in the park on the age of people in your party.  Young children or elderly may require longer and more frequent breaks.  One option is to go to the park in the morning, go back to your hotel in the afternoon for a dip in the pool, and return to the park later afternoon or evening.  Pay attention to the park hours to know how early you can arrive and how late you can stay.  Most parks have some sort of parade and fireworks show at closing.  Most are very worthwhile to see.

What is Assembler?,"An assembler program creates object code by translating combinations of mnemonics and syntax for operations and addressing modes into their numerical equivalents. This representation typically includes an operation code (""opcode"") as well as other control bits and data. The assembler also calculates constant expressions and resolves symbolic names for memory locations and other entities. The use of symbolic references is a key feature of assemblers, saving tedious calculations and manual address updates after program modifications. Most assemblers also include macro facilities for performing textual substitution – e.g., to generate common short sequences of instructions as inline, instead of called subroutines.

Some assemblers may also be able to perform some simple types of instruction set-specific optimizations. One concrete example of this may be the ubiquitous x86 assemblers from various vendors. Called jump-sizing, most of them are able to perform jump-instruction replacements (long jumps replaced by short or relative jumps) in any number of passes, on request. Others may even do simple rearrangement or insertion of instructions, such as some assemblers for RISC architectures that can help optimize a sensible instruction scheduling to exploit the CPU pipeline as efficiently as possible."

Since release, Destiny 2 has released numerous additional content through expansion packs and seasonal content that expands the storyline and background lore of the universe in which the game takes place as well as new locations to explore and activities to engage in.

In Destiny 2, players assume the role of Guardians, who are gifted with the power of ""Light"" that allows them to protect the remnants of humanity that survived a catastrophic event of an event called ""The collapse."" This science fiction background and futuristic aesthetic combine to provide both a story-rich and feature-rich gameplay experience.

Destiny 2 is classed as a ""looter shooter"" first person shooter, which is a sub-genre of video games that feature procedurally generated equipment and weapons which encourages players to replay game content to achieve the best possible combinations of benefits from the items they receive. Furthermore, Destiny 2 is also commonly referred to as a  role playing game, elements of which allow users to customize their characters abilities and appearance and specialize in certain roles within the game. As new content is released into the game, this encourages players to experiment with new abilities, weapons, and equipment to achieve optimal performance and creates a satisfying gameplay loop or experience.

The game features two main modes of play. The first, which is classified as ""Player Versus Environment"", or PvE, pits the players against AI-controlled enemies in either solo content, group content (called fireteams) of 3 players, or raids of up to 6 players. Players team up in fireteams and raids to tackle more challenging content and in turn are rewarded with more unique or rare pieces of equipment. Additionally, there are ""Player vs Player"", or PvP modes in the game that allows players to compete against each other in competitive modes against each other. Both modes feature exclusive gameplay modes, locations, and objectives.

Finally, Destiny 2 features a rich cast of diverse actors and actresses that lend their voice talent to the game for their characters, such as Nathan Fillon, Lance Reddick, Nolan North, Lennie James, and many other noteworthy artists.

Senators and representatives are chosen through direct election, though vacancies in the Senate may be filled by a governor's appointment. Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives. The U.S. vice president has a vote in the Senate only when senators are evenly divided. The House of Representatives has six non-voting members.

The sitting of a Congress is for a two-year term, at present, beginning every other January. Elections are held every even-numbered year on Election Day. The members of the House of Representatives are elected for the two-year term of a Congress. The Reapportionment Act of 1929 established that there be 435 representatives, and the Uniform Congressional Redistricting Act requires that they be elected from single-member constituencies or districts. It is also required that the congressional districts be apportioned among states by population every ten years using the U.S. census results, provided that each state has at least one congressional representative. Each senator is elected at-large in their state for a six-year term, with terms staggered, so every two years approximately one-third of the Senate is up for election. Each state, regardless of population or size, has two senators, so currently, there are 100 senators for the 50 states."

"What is the analysis of mutations in cancer, in genomics?","In cancer, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown point mutations in a variety of genes in cancer. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of human genome sequences and germline polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as oligonucleotide microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called comparative genomic hybridization), and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays to detect known point mutations. These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate terabytes of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or noise, and thus Hidden Markov model and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real copy number changes.

Two important principles can be used in the analysis of cancer genomes bioinformatically pertaining to the identification of mutations in the exome. First, cancer is a disease of accumulated somatic mutations in genes. Second cancer contains driver mutations which need to be distinguished from passengers.

With the breakthroughs that this next-generation sequencing technology is providing to the field of Bioinformatics, cancer genomics could drastically change. These new methods and software allow bioinformaticians to sequence many cancer genomes quickly and affordably. This could create a more flexible process for classifying types of cancer by analysis of cancer driven mutations in the genome. Furthermore, tracking of patients while the disease progresses may be possible in the future with the sequence of cancer samples.

Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of lesions found to be recurrent among many tumors."

How should I maintain my bicycle?,"Keep your bicycle clean. Most important of all, keep your bicycle’s drivetrain clean. A bicycle’s drivetrain is the chain, chainrings and pulleys which make the rear wheel turn. If you can, wipe down the drivetrain with a cleaning lubricant made for bicycle drivetrains after each long ride, or every other short ride. Doing so will ensure that your ride is noticeably more enjoyable. Shifting will remain smooth and reliable, and pedaling will be easier. Dirty drivetrains are squeaky and loud. Your clean drivetrain will be nice and quiet. Your clean drivetrain will also last much longer since you are regularly cleaning away the dirt and other road grit and sweat which collects in the chain and grinds away everything it touches. If you are unable to maintain your bicycle, take it to the local bike shop at least once a year for maintenance and tune up. You won’t regret it."

What is oxidation reduction potential?,"Oxidation reduction potential or ORP is measurement for water.  A millivolt meter can measure ORP and it is a measure of the potential of water to carry or hold antioxidants.  It is not a guarantee of antioxidants in water.  One form of antioxidants in water is free floating dissolved hydrogen.  A good analogy of antioxidants in water is the following: ORP is like a big swimming pool of potential but at the moment its currently empty and dissolved hydrogen is like ball of finite size.  The larger the ORP 'swimming pool' the more dissolved hydrogen 'balls' can fit in that pool.  An ORP with a large negative value is huge swimming pool, and an OPR with a high positive value is no swimming pool.  ORP can also measure whether water is acidic or alkaline.  ORP that is negative tends more toward alkaline water, and ORP which is positive tends more towards neutral water and acidic water."

What is carnitine?,"Carnitine is a quaternary ammonium compound involved in metabolism in most mammals, plants, and some bacteria. In support of energy metabolism, carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria to be oxidized for free energy production, and also participates in removing products of metabolism from cells. Given its key metabolic roles, carnitine is concentrated in tissues like skeletal and cardiac muscle that metabolize fatty acids as an energy source. Generally individuals, including strict vegetarians, synthesize enough L-carnitine in vivo.

Carnitine exists as one of two stereoisomers (the two enantiomers d-carnitine (S-(+)-) and l-carnitine (R-(−)-)). Both are biologically active, but only l-carnitine naturally occurs in animals, and d-carnitine is toxic as it inhibits the activity of the l-form. At room temperature, pure carnitine is a whiteish powder, and a water-soluble zwitterion with relatively low toxicity. Derived from amino acids, carnitine was first extracted from meat extracts in 1905, leading to its name from Latin, ""caro/carnis"" or flesh.

Some individuals with genetic or medical disorders (such as preterm infants) cannot make enough carnitine, requiring dietary supplementation. Despite common carnitine supplement consumption among athletes for improved exercise performance or recovery, there is insufficient high-quality clinical evidence to indicate it provides any benefit."

For example, a lots of fans consider that Liverpool, which holds the record for the most champion league title wins from premier league, is the best club in the league. Manchester City has also been performing great in the past decade and has been considered the best club in the league for the past 10 years."
How does a noise-cancelling headphone work?,A noise-canceling headphone can actively monitor the background noise and generate an opposite waveform to negate the noise and prevent it from reaching your ear. Sound is transmitted as waveforms in the air and the measurement of the sound is the amplitude. A noise-canceling device can generate an inverted waveform to match a noise peak with a trough and vice versa. When combining the noise waveform and the inverted waveform their amplitude becomes zero and the noise feels like it is canceled.

How do you build a roof?,"Roofs are more complex than they look from the outside. Here are the basic steps to building a roof:

1. Build out the shape of the roof with a wood frame. This is the roof's skeleton.
2. Cover the frame with decking. Decking is the first layer of the roof. It's a thin piece of wood that all the other material will rest on. 
3. Add an underlayment on top of the decking. This is a synthetic barrier that guards against water and fire, and helps the roof maintain its shape if the wood under it expands or contracts.
4. Add flashing around vertical elements on the roof. Flashing is a thin sheet of metal that prevents water from getting into gaps around vertical elements like chimneys and vents.
5. Apply shingles to the roof. Shingles are made of asphalt and they are the outermost layer of a roof. Shingles are the first line of defense in protecting your home, but they can also add color and design elements to your home."

It has even been used to find talent all over the world even from under developed nations where only a camera and internet connection is needed to showcase your talent to the world.  Social media is also used for selling and buying too."
What is an allele?,"An allele is a variation of the same sequence of nucleotides at the same place on a long DNA molecule, as described in leading textbooks on genetics and evolution.

The word ""Allele"" is a short form of ""allelomorph"".

""The chromosomal or genomic location of a gene or any other genetic element is called a locus (plural: loci) and alternative DNA sequences at a locus are called alleles.""

The simplest alleles are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), but they can also be insertions and deletions of up to several thousand base pairs.

Popular definitions of 'allele' typically refer only to different alleles within genes. For example, the ABO blood grouping is controlled by the ABO gene, which has six common alleles (variants). In population genetics, nearly every living human's phenotype for the ABO gene is some combination of just these six alleles.

Most alleles observed result in little or no change in the function of the gene product it codes for. However, sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic traits, such as different pigmentation. A notable example of this is Gregor Mendel's discovery that the white and purple flower colors in pea plants were the result of a single gene with two alleles.

Nearly all multicellular organisms have two sets of chromosomes at some point in their biological life cycle; that is, they are diploid. In this case, the chromosomes can be paired. Each chromosome in the pair contains the same genes in the same order, and place, along the length of the chromosome. For a given gene, if the two chromosomes contain the same allele, they, and the organism, are homozygous with respect to that gene. If the alleles are different, they, and the organism, are heterozygous with respect to that gene."
"Inflation means that the general level of prices is going up, the opposite of deflation. More money will be needed to pay for goods (like a loaf of bread) and services (like getting a haircut at the hairdresser's).","Inflation means that the general level of prices is going up, the opposite of deflation. More money will be needed to pay for goods (like a loaf of bread) and services (like getting a haircut at the hairdresser's). Economists measure inflation regularly to know an economy's state.

What is the nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins?,"Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins (usually abbreviated protein NMR) is a field of structural biology in which NMR spectroscopy is used to obtain information about the structure and dynamics of proteins, and also nucleic acids, and their complexes. The field was pioneered by Richard R. Ernst and Kurt Wüthrich at the ETH, and by Ad Bax, Marius Clore, Angela Gronenborn at the NIH, and Gerhard Wagner at Harvard University, among others. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy usually consists of several phases, each using a separate set of highly specialized techniques. The sample is prepared, measurements are made, interpretive approaches are applied, and a structure is calculated and validated.

NMR involves the quantum-mechanical properties of the central core (""nucleus"") of the atom. These properties depend on the local molecular environment, and their measurement provides a map of how the atoms are linked chemically, how close they are in space, and how rapidly they move with respect to each other. These properties are fundamentally the same as those used in the more familiar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the molecular applications use a somewhat different approach, appropriate to the change of scale from millimeters (of interest to radiologists) to nanometers (bonded atoms are typically a fraction of a nanometer apart), a factor of a million. This change of scale requires much higher sensitivity of detection and stability for long term measurement. In contrast to MRI, structural biology studies do not directly generate an image, but rely on complex computer calculations to generate three-dimensional molecular models.

Currently most samples are examined in a solution in water, but methods are being developed to also work with solid samples. Data collection relies on placing the sample inside a powerful magnet, sending radio frequency signals through the sample, and measuring the absorption of those signals. Depending on the environment of atoms within the protein, the nuclei of individual atoms will absorb different frequencies of radio signals. Furthermore, the absorption signals of different nuclei may be perturbed by adjacent nuclei. This information can be used to determine the distance between nuclei. These distances in turn can be used to determine the overall structure of the protein.

A typical study might involve how two proteins interact with each other, possibly with a view to developing small molecules that can be used to probe the normal biology of the interaction (""chemical biology"") or to provide possible leads for pharmaceutical use (drug development). Frequently, the interacting pair of proteins may have been identified by studies of human genetics, indicating the interaction can be disrupted by unfavorable mutations, or they may play a key role in the normal biology of a ""model"" organism like the fruit fly, yeast, the worm C. elegans, or mice. To prepare a sample, methods of molecular biology are typically used to make quantities by bacterial fermentation. This also permits changing the isotopic composition of the molecule, which is desirable because the isotopes behave differently and provide methods for identifying overlapping NMR signals."

What is DNA sequencing?,"DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleic acid sequence – the order of nucleotides in DNA. It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has greatly accelerated biological and medical research and discovery.

Knowledge of DNA sequences has become indispensable for basic biological research, DNA Genographic Projects and in numerous applied fields such as medical diagnosis, biotechnology, forensic biology, virology and biological systematics. Comparing healthy and mutated DNA sequences can diagnose different diseases including various cancers, characterize antibody repertoire, and can be used to guide patient treatment. Having a quick way to sequence DNA allows for faster and more individualized medical care to be administered, and for more organisms to be identified and cataloged.

The rapid speed of sequencing attained with modern DNA sequencing technology has been instrumental in the sequencing of complete DNA sequences, or genomes, of numerous types and species of life, including the human genome and other complete DNA sequences of many animal, plant, and microbial species.

The first DNA sequences were obtained in the early 1970s by academic researchers using laborious methods based on two-dimensional chromatography. Following the development of fluorescence-based sequencing methods with a DNA sequencer, DNA sequencing has become easier and orders of magnitude faster.["

How can the Federal Reserve control inflation?,"The Federal Reserve has a ""dual mandate"" to both keep prices stable and maintain the highest level of sustainable employment. Controlling inflation falls into the scope of price stability. The Fed has three main tools to achieve this goal. First, they can change the Federal Funds Rate which is the interest rate used by banks for inter-bank lending and is the foundation for interest rates more broadly. An increase in the Federal Funds Rate, will cause interest rates to increase for loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc. The higher costs of interest rates cause prices to decrease. Second, the Fed can set expectations for path of the Federal Funds Rate via announcements from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and ""Fed Speak"" from individual Fed governors. These updates and commentary are based on the Feds marcoeconcomic forecasts and the individual opinions of the Fed governors. These expectations can influence the publics expectation for inflation and therefore the actual path of inflation. Lastly, the Fed has many technical tools for influencing credit markets and the interest rates on government bonds. These tools involve buying/selling US treasuries or providing assurances to select credit markets. These actions can tighten/loosen these credit markets and therfore indirectly influence actual interest rates. In summary, all three tools used by the Fed play a part in the strategy for controlling inflation."

Many will argue that wood or charcoal gives more of a flavor to the food being cooked.  But, there are remedies to this for propane, including getting what is commonly known as a smoker box to generate smoke flavor.

What is the least common birthday?,"The least common birthday in the modern Gregorian calendar is February 29. This is because of leap years, as February 29 occurs only a bit more than a quarter of the time in any given calendar year.

However excluding February 29, in most Western countries the least common birthday is December 25. For instance, in the United States between 1973 and 1999, September 16 is the most common birthday and December 25 the least common birthday. Some other uncommon birthdays in the West are January 1, December 24, and April 1.

The least common birthday is usually a holiday when most people take time off work. There are multiple reasons why these days have fewer births, but one reason is that doctors are less likely to schedule cesarean births on such days. April 1 is an exception, and is likely because parents who are able to choose not to give birth on that day, to prevent their children from being bullied for having their birthday on April Fool's Day.

This question is harder to answer in many non-Western countries as there is less easily accessible data. For example in a survey of students in India between 2007 and 2012, the statistics show much more births just before school opens, and on round days like the 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th. This indicates much of the data may be faked."

What is Asperger syndrome?,"Asperger syndrome (AS), or Asperger's, is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. The syndrome is no longer recognized as a diagnosis, having been merged with other conditions into autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It was considered to differ from other diagnoses that were incorporated into ASD by relatively unimpaired spoken language and intelligence.

The syndrome was named after the Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger, who, in 1944, described children in his care who struggled to form friendships, did not understand others’ gestures or feelings, engaged in one-sided conversations about their favorite interests, and were clumsy. In 1994, the diagnosis of Asperger's was included in the fourth edition (DSM-IV) of the American Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; however, with the publication of DSM-5 in 2013, the syndrome was removed, and the symptoms are now included within autism spectrum disorder along with classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). It was similarly merged into autism spectrum disorder in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2021.

The exact cause of Asperger's is poorly understood. While it has high heritability, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying condition. There is no single treatment, and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) guidelines suggest that ’treatment’ of any form of autism should not be a goal since autism is not an 'a disease that can be removed or cured’. According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, while co-occurring conditions might require treatment, ’management of autism itself is chiefly about providing the education, training and social support/care required to improve the person's ability to function in the everyday world’. Only limited data support the effectiveness of particular interventions for autism. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems, such as mood or anxiety. Autistic characteristics tend to become less evident in adulthood , but social and communication difficulties usually persist."

What is the last step before a star collapses into a black hole?,"Stars that have a higher mass than about 2.2 solar masses (the mass of our Sun) will typically collapse into black holes at the end of their life cycle when fusion has stopped and no longer pushes out against the inward pull of gravity. For stars of this mass, their inward pull of gravity is too strong to be resisted by other forces, thus their fate is to become black holes. However, stars under this limit and above the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses will end their lifecycles as neutron stars. Neutron stars are also the remnants of dead stars but since they have a smaller mass, their gravity is not enough for them to cross into becoming black holes. As the dead star compresses and becomes more and more dense, regular matter is turned into neutrons and the last force to resist the pull of gravity is called degenerate neutron pressure, which is a quantum effect that dictates that no two neutrons may be in the same quantum state. This creates an outward pressure that resists the pull of gravity and settles the star into a neutron star. If more mass is added later, from a star companion or other sources, once the star's mass crosses the limit of around 2.2 solar masses even degenerate neutron pressure isn't enough to balance gravity and the star will collapse into a black hole."

Explain Ionizing radiation as a twelve years old kid.,"Ionizing radiation is caused when a very heavy atom emits a particle at the speed of light called ionizing radiation.
On contact with a material, either the atom absorbs the ionizing particle or 
The ionizing particle breaks the atom in two and forms two ionizing particles which can create a chain reaction.
There are three kinds of ionizing particles: alpha, beta and gamma
Alpha particles react a lot with matter but travel a very short distance.

Beta particles react less than alpha particles with matter but travel a very short distance. 
Alpha particles react less than alpha particles with matter but travel a longer distance than alpha particles.

Gamma particles react less with matter than beta particles but travel a longer distance than beta particles."

What is the Monty Hall problem?,"The Monty Hall problem is a probability brain teaser that many consider to be counterintuitive. The problem is stated as follows: Imagine you are a contestant on a game show and the host shows you 3 doors. Behind one of the doors is a car and behind the other two are goats. The prizes have been randomly assigned to the doors and you want to win the car. The host allows you to pick one of the doors as a first selection. Then, the host opens one of the remaining doors and reveals a goat is behind it. The host now allows you to decide if you want to switch from your selected door to the remaining unopened door. Should you switch, to maximize your probability of winning the car?

Most people believe switching does not improve your probability of winning the car. However switching does increase your probability of winning the car from 1/3 to 2/3. An intuitive way to understand this problem is by first considering the initial state. At your first selection the probability that you have selected the right door is 1/3 and the probability that the car remains behind one of the two unselected doors is 2/3. Then the host reveals more information. The host reveals that one of the unselected doors does not have the car behind it. The probability that the originally unselected doors must have the car behind one of them is still 2/3, but you now know one of them specifically which does not have the car. Therefore, the remaining unopened unselected door must have a probability of 2/3 to contain the car, and your originally selected door must have a probability of 1/3. When offered the chance, you should switch to maximize your chances of winning the car."
What is the list of football clubs in England by competitive honours won?,"This article lists English association football clubs whose men's sides have won competitive honours run by official governing bodies. Friendly competitions and matches organized between clubs are not included. The football associations FIFA and UEFA run international and European competitions; while The Football Association, and its mostly self-governing subsidiary bodies the English Football League and Premier League, run national competitions.

The European governing body UEFA was founded in 1954, and created their first and most prestigious competition, the European Cup, the next year. It was expanded and renamed in 1992 as the UEFA Champions League. Liverpool hold the English record, with six wins. Parallel to UEFA, various officials created the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1955, but this competition was disbanded when UEFA created the replacement tournament, UEFA Cup, in 1971 (renamed the UEFA Europa League in 2009) The English record number of Europa League wins is three, also held by Liverpool. Another competition absorbed into the UEFA Cup, in 1999, was the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, which was created in 1960 and featured the winners of national knockout competitions The winners of this competition played the European Cup winners in the UEFA Super Cup, starting in 1972 (recognised by UEFA in 1973), which now features the winners of the Champions League and Europa League.Liverpool also hold the English record, with four wins, in the UEFA Super Cup. The International Football Cup, also known as the UEFA Intertoto Cup, was a competition for clubs not participating in the European Cup, UEFA Cup or Cup Winners' Cup. The tournament commenced in 1961, but UEFA officially recognised it only in 1995, and discontinued in 2008, with the Europa League expanded to accommodate Intertoto Cup clubs. UEFA and CONMEBOL also created an intercontinental competition in 1960, the Intercontinental Cup, featuring continental champions from both associations. In 2000, the international governing body FIFA created the FIFA Club World Cup and in 2004 the Intercontinental Cup was merged into it. Manchester United are the only English club to have won the Intercontinental Cup, while United, Chelsea and Liverpool are the only English teams to have lifted the Club World Cup.

England's first competition organised by a national body, the FA Cup, began in the 1871–72 season, making it one of the oldest football competitions in the world.Arsenal hold the record number of wins, with 14. League football began in the next decade with the founding of The Football League in 1888–89. The name First Division was adopted in 1892, when The Football League gained a second division. The First Division remained the highest division of the English league system until 1992, when the Premier League was founded. Manchester United have won the most top division titles, 20. The English equivalent of the super cup began in 1898 with the inauguration of the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, pitting the best professional and amateur sides of the year against each other. The trophy would develop into the FA Charity Shield in 1908, which was later renamed the FA Community Shield in 2002. Manchester United also hold the record here, with 21 wins. The Football League created its own knockout competition in 1960, the League Cup. Its current record is nine wins, held by Liverpool. The Anglo-Italian League Cup was created in 1969 to match English cup winners against the winners of the Coppa Italia, and was permanently disbanded in 1976. In 1985, the Full Members' Cup and Football League Super Cup were created as substitutes for UEFA competitions after UEFA responded to the Heysel Stadium disaster by banning English clubs. They finished in 1992 and 1986, respectively. The Football League Centenary Trophy marked The Football League's 100th birthday, in the 1988–89 season 

Lower down in the hierarchy of English football are many other competitions, not included in the tables on this page. These include competitions run by the above national governing bodies, but organised for clubs ineligible for higher competitions. For example, the Texaco Cup and EFL Trophy. Regional competitions are organised by County Football Associations. In the years when league football was unavailable or only available to northern and midlands clubs, the county competitions coexisted with the FA Cup as the main tournaments for clubs. Nowadays, county cups are contested by lower or regional division teams and those that still participate generally field youth or reserve sides."

"How to get an efficient cardio workout and improve your speed, and gain other health benefits?","In this day and age when many are busy with work, family, electronic gadgets, social media it becomes increasingly challenging to find the time to exercise.  Staying healthy will allow you to enjoy those distractions longer, but jokes aside it will make you feel energized, motivated and bring out the best in you.  When new discoveries in scenic areas are correctly applied, you don’t need to spend multiple hours at the gym, you don’t have to starve to achieve your goals, this concept was very enticing to me when I first learnt about the Sprint 8 program at my local gym.  I decided to give this a try!

Sprint 8 - Its a 20 minute routine, where you spend the first 30 seconds working out at the highest level of intensity (go all out) followed by 90 seconds of active recovery, repeat this 8 times..  You can use a bike, treadmill, elliptical whichever suits your style.  In all my life of being fairly active, Sprint 8 has the toughest workout, but over a year I could see significant results.  I was able to run faster, lower blood pressure, reduce fat percentage, and improve muscle mass.  The key differentiator about this program is that it engages all the three muscle fiber types and releases exercise induced growth hormones to help your body become stronger, leaner and healthier.

Another advantage is that this program really reduces any change of injury that one may face by running, heavy weight lifting etc therefore allowing you to sustain the exercise program for years to come.  

Give this a try and gain the benefits of efficient exercising."

Explain gravity,"Gravity is a fundamental interaction which causes mutual attraction between all things with mass or energy. Gravity is the weakest of the four fundamental interactions namely the strong, weak, electromagnetic and gravity. However, it is the most significant interaction between objects at the macroscopic scale, and it determines the motion of planets, stars, galaxies, and even light. 
Gravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity that was proposed by Albert Einstein. The theory describes gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of spacetime, caused by the uneven distribution of mass, and causing masses to move along geodesic lines.
However, for most applications, gravity is well approximated by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which describes gravity as a force causing any two bodies to be attracted toward each other, with magnitude proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them."

There are two methods of a cashless exercise.  The first method is a net settlement, where the company withholds a sufficient number of shares with a fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price, and such withheld shares constitute payment of the exercise price.  The second method is a sell-to-cover (or same-day sale), where sufficient shares equal to the aggregate exercise price are sold and the proceeds are used to pay the exercise price.  Generally, the second method is available only for companies whose shares are publicly traded, as there is greater complexity to use this method for privately held companies."

Restricted stock is often used as a form of employee compensation, in which case it typically becomes transferable (""vests"") upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as continued employment for a period of time or the achievement of particular product-development milestones, earnings per share goals or other financial targets. Restricted stock is a popular alternative to stock options, particularly for executives, due to favorable accounting rules and income tax treatment."
What is CRISPR?,"CRISPR  (an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a family of DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea. These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that had previously infected the prokaryote. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral (i.e. anti-phage) defense system of prokaryotes and provide a form of acquired immunity. CRISPR is found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea.

Cas9 (or ""CRISPR-associated protein 9"") is an enzyme that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and cleave specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence. Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that can be used to edit genes within organisms. This editing process has a wide variety of applications including basic biological research, development of biotechnological products, and treatment of diseases. The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 which was awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna.

In 2022, in a proceeding at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (interference 106,115), the Patent Trial and Appeal Board decided that the inventor for the US patent covering application of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells is Feng Zhang, a professor of the Broad Institute."

What are the options for you to use as an egg substitute when you are vegan?,"When you are vegan you don’t eat any animal products or by-products. Depending on what you are making and what you are looking for from a taste perspective there are several options for you to substitute eggs. 

Silken Tofu - If you are making a vegan scramble, quiche, or homemade vegan mayonnaise. The creamy texture can help mimic the egg’s soft texture in your breakfast meals and desserts.
Unsweetened applesauce - You can use a quarter cup of unsweetened applesauce for one egg. It adds moisture and sweetness to what you are making. The natural fruit pectin also helps bind the ingredients. It can be dense than an egg in your baking so you may need to use a teaspoon of baking powder to encourage fluffiness. 
Mashed banana - This has a very distinct flavor, so only use it in recipes when you think the banana flavor will complement what you are making. This works well in pancakes, brownies, and banana bread. You can use a ripe medium mashed banana for every large egg. The starches and sugars in the banana help develop a beautiful golden brown crust. 
Aquafaba - This is an ideal substitute for egg whites, giving your dessert structure. Take three tablespoons of liquid from inside your can of chickpeas and whip them to a fluffy consistency. 
Flaxseeds or Chia Seeds - This is best for recipes that don’t require too many eggs. Combine one tablespoon of seeds with three tablespoons of water for every large egg. Let it sit for 20 minutes to get a slimy mixture that mimics and egg.
Baking Soda and Vinegar - Mix a teaspoon of baking soda and a tablespoon of white vinegar together to help create the air bubbles needed in things like pancakes, cookies, and quick breads. This is ideal where two or less eggs are needed."

How did the United States win the Cold War?,"A number of factors contributed to the United States defeating the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in the Cold War and becoming the world's most powerful state. A common view is that the U.S. won the Cold War because its capitalist economic system, characterized by free markets and the recognition of private property rights, was able to outperform the USSR's centrally-planned economy. The United States could therefore afford to spend more on its military than the USSR and won the nuclear arms race, which contributed to the internal collapse of the Soviet economy and the subsequent breakup of the Soviet Union into smaller, individual states with democratic elections. Additionally, though the USSR and the United States never officially engaged in direct military conflict with one another during the Cold War, various factions supported by the United States and its Western allies were able to successfully defeat Soviet-backed factions in proxy wars that took place all across the globe (with the notable exception of Vietnam). These defeats gradually limited the USSR's ability to project its power on the world stage, and helped the United States build and strengthen key alliances, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Finally, the United States carried out effective intelligence, counter-intelligence, disinformation and propaganda campaigns that undermined the faith the USSR's population had in its government and buttressed support for the U.S. government's efforts domestically. By 1991, the Soviet Union had fallen and the U.S. had achieved global hegemony."

"Tell me a fun fact about Boca Raton, Florida","Boca Raton was once home to a military airfield that was used during World War II to train pilots on a new military radio technology; the radar.  Pilots were trained to fly in B-17 and B-29 bombers using the radars created by MIT which would eventually allow us to win the war.  The Boca Raton Army Airfield was the only airborne radar training facility during the war.  Military planes from across the United States would have to come to this base if they wanted the radar technology to be installed.  The location of this base made it optimal to maintain secrecy as it was very rural and largely uninhabited still, providing access to thousands of acres of unused land.  The base was also just a few short miles from the Atlantic Ocean, making it the perfect place to stealthily fly and practice using the radar technology.  Other benefits to the location was the year round warm climate."

What is the legal difference between laches and waiver?,"In legal parlance, laches is a defense which when raised implies the plaintiff caused inordinate delay, was part of the act of which it complains or caused prejudice to a defendant due to any delay. The Statute of Limitations is a common example of laches where a plaintiff is precluded from bringing an action due to inordinate delay.

A defense of waiver claims that the plaintiff knowingly and intentionally signed away, relinquished or otherwise abandoned the right which it claims was violated by the defendant. A common example of a waiver is when one engages in a dangerous act for pleasure such as sky diving or rock climbing. The instructor or facility would have the purchaser sign a waiver for bodily harm suffered from engaging in the dangerous act.

Both defenses are affirmative defenses and must be raised for them to take effect. It is important to note that affirmative defenses can themselves fall to laches and waiver."

What is glass made of,"Glass has become so commonplace today that it’s easy to see right through it without a second thought. It’s in our windows, on our screens, in our cabinets, and in many of the devices we interact with every day. Even though glass can be found everywhere, you may live your whole life not knowing much about how it’s made or what it’s composed of. Even if you think you know the basics, you’ve only skimmed the surface.   

At a high level, glass is sand that’s been melted down and chemically transformed. If you’ve ever been to the beach, you know exactly how hot sand can get while remaining in its solid form. The kind of heat necessary to transform sand into a liquid state (eventually becoming glass) is much hotter than any sunny day. To make sand melt, you need to heat it to roughly 1700°C (3090°F), which is approximately the same temperature a space shuttle reaches as it re-enters earth’s atmosphere.

The sand commonly used to make glass is comprised of small grains of quartz crystals, made up of molecules of silicon dioxide, which is also known as silica. When those molecules are heated to high enough temperatures, the sand melts and loses its crystalline structure, and as it cools it gains an entirely different structure. That structure, on a molecular level, is somewhere in between a liquid and a solid. This in-between state is known as an amorphous solid, which means it has some of the crystalline structure of a solid coupled with the molecular randomness of a liquid.

Glass Melting
Depending on the sand mixture, glass can have a variety of properties. Certain elements or chemicals mixed with sand can change glass’s color, for example. Glass’s properties can also change based on how it’s manufactured and the processes by which it’s shaped afterward. To strengthen glass, manufacturers can use thermal tempering to heat and cool it rapidly. Glass can also be strengthened chemically through an ion exchange process that makes the surface of the glass tougher.

The glass most people are familiar with is soda-lime glass, which is a combination of soda (also known as soda ash or washing soda), limestone, and sand. Although you can make glass simply by heating and then rapidly cooling silica, the manufacturing of soda-lime glass is a little more complex. By adding soda (sodium carbonate), the melting point of the sand is reduced so it can be transformed into glass at lower temperatures and save energy during manufacturing. However, adding soda to the mixture reduces its chemical durability, making it prone to dissolve when in contact with liquids. For most applications, that’s not desirable, so limestone (calcium carbonate) is also added to the mixture, which acts as a stabilizer. Once the mixture of silica, soda, and limestone is heated, it can be cooled and molded for a variety of applications. 
At Corning, we know glass. We know how to strengthen it through chemical processes like ion exchange, and we know how to bend it to make optical fiber that can stretch over vast distances. Our knowledge of glass goes back more than a century, allowing us to remain on the cutting edge of research and development. From simple soda-lime to complex glass structures that enable augmented reality, glass is an adaptable, wide-ranging material. That’s why, after more than 165 years, we’re still making new discoveries."
What is a cat?,"A cat is a cute, cuddly animal with whiskers, pointed ears, four legs and paws, and a tail. Cats are companion animals to humans. Cats can come in many different varieties, such as hairless, short-haired, medium-haired, and very fluffy; they also come in many colors, such as black, white, grey, brown, orange, and a combination of multiple colors."
Where do we go when we die?,"In some religions, it is believed we go to heaven after die.  There are passages that talk about the pearly gates and being greeted by St. Peter who will check you into heaven and allow to pass through the gates once vetted.  The ancient egyptians believed in three afterlife ideologies; the underworld, eternal life and the rebirth of the soul.  However, for the average person today who does not partake in mummification and ancient egyptians, it is widely believed that once the body dies, the soul leaves and goes to a place of peace.  In a perfect world, we would be reunited with our loved ones, both human and pet, where we would no longer be in pain and can run free with those we care about most.  Alternatively, the more literal answer to this question would be that the physical body either goes into a coffin or some type of container or it is cremated into ashes after death."

Why is pricing important in the overall strategy of a product?,"When different profit levers like price, variable cost, fixed cost, volume of goods sold are compared, studies show that a 1% improvement in price can create the maximum operating profit improvement of 11.5% compared to only 2.3% through fixed costs. This goes to show that pricing can have a monumental impact on the bottom line. 

This can be achieved by understanding different pricing strategies and how they can be executed through pricing tactics. The different pricing strategy includes using - 1. Cost-side factors (like fixed, variable costs, incremental break-even analysis); 2. Customer-side factors (like Economic Value Analysis (EVA); Price Elasticity of Demand; Measuring willingness to pay) 3. Competitive environment factors. 

Based on the business context, these strategies can be implemented with tacts like price discrimination (e.g., bundling); non-linear pricing; price promotions (e.g., hi-lo pricing); and most of all understanding consumer psychology with respect to pricing (anchoring effect, decoy pricing, compromise effect, charm pricing, etc)."

What is the difference between a snap shot and a slap shot in hockey?,"A snap shot is an abbreviated wrist shot in ice hockey. The purpose of the snap shot is to combine the main advantages of the wrist shot (shot accuracy and quick delivery) and slap shot (puck speed).

The snap shot is accomplished with a quick snap of the wrists while the puck rests in place.  The slap shot, on the other hand, is accomplished with a wind-up involving lifting the hockey stick to shoulder height or higher and then slapping the ice slightly behind the puck, using the weight to bend the stick, storing energy in it like a spring. The player then rolls their wrists and shifts their weight so that the energy stored in the stick is released through the puck."

What is connectomics?,"Connectomics is the production and study of connectomes: comprehensive maps of connections within an organism's nervous system. More generally, it can be thought of as the study of neuronal wiring diagrams with a focus on how structural connectivity, individual synapses, cellular morphology, and cellular ultrastructure contribute to the make up of a network. The nervous system is a network made of billions of connections and these connections are responsible for our thoughts, emotions, actions, memories, function and dysfunction. Therefore, the study of connectomics aims to advance our understanding of mental health and cognition by understanding how cells in the nervous system are connected and communicate. Because these structures are extremely complex, methods within this field use a high-throughput application of functional and structural neural imaging, most commonly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electron microscopy, and histological techniques in order to increase the speed, efficiency, and resolution of these nervous system maps. To date, tens of large scale datasets have been collected spanning the nervous system including the various areas of cortex, cerebellum, the retina, the peripheral nervous system and neuromuscular junctions.

Generally speaking, there are two types of connectomes; macroscale and microscale. Macroscale connectomics refers to using functional and structural MRI data to map out large fiber tracts and functional gray matter areas within the brain in terms of blood flow (functional) and water diffusivity (structural). Microscale connectomics is the mapping of small organisms' complete connectome using microscopy and histology. That is, all connections that exist in their central nervous system."

Is toastmasters a good organization to join?,"Toastmasters is an organization that has been around for nearly 100 years.  It is an organization that helps its members to become competent communicators and competent leaders.  They achieve this by delivering prepared speeches that are evaluated during Toastmasters meetings.  You get evaluated on filler words used, grammatical construction of your speech, speech tonality, and a general evaluation of your speech.  This works so well because you get practical insight into where you can improve in your communication skills in delivering prepared speeches.  You can also fill different roles like treasurer, and president roles to help you build leadership skills."

"What was the primary reason for the mutiny that occurred in 1857, in British India?","There were several reasons that can be attributed to the mutiny that occurred in 1857, but one of the major reasons was related to the Hindu religious beliefs. Most of the British army were comprised of Hindus who were extremely religious. The Britishers were insensitive to their religious beliefs, for e.g. they were asked to chew of the bullet before using it in their rifles that was made of animal fat. Most Hindus in the army were religiously vegetarian and were offended when asked to bite meat. This event started bringing together the Hindus in the army to plot a revolt against the Britishers. Mangal Panday, one of the Hindu soldiers has been credited with being the leader of this revolt and this revolt is often referred to as the first war of Indian independence."

What is proteomics?,"Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins. Proteins are vital parts of living organisms, with many functions such as the formation of structural fibers of muscle tissue, enzymatic digestion of food, or synthesis and replication of DNA. In addition, other kinds of proteins include antibodies that protect an organism from infection, and hormones that send important signals throughout the body.

The proteome is the entire set of proteins produced or modified by an organism or system. Proteomics enables the identification of ever-increasing numbers of proteins. This varies with time and distinct requirements, or stresses, that a cell or organism undergoes.

Proteomics is an interdisciplinary domain that has benefited greatly from the genetic information of various genome projects, including the Human Genome Project. It covers the exploration of proteomes from the overall level of protein composition, structure, and activity, and is an important component of functional genomics.

Proteomics generally denotes the large-scale experimental analysis of proteins and proteomes, but often refers specifically to protein purification and mass spectrometry. Indeed, mass spectrometry is the most powerful method for analysis of proteomes, both in large samples composed of millions of cells and in single cells."

What is structural genomics?,"Structural genomics seeks to describe the 3-dimensional structure of every protein encoded by a given genome. This genome-based approach allows for a high-throughput method of structure determination by a combination of experimental and modeling approaches. The principal difference between structural genomics and traditional structural prediction is that structural genomics attempts to determine the structure of every protein encoded by the genome, rather than focusing on one particular protein. With full-genome sequences available, structure prediction can be done more quickly through a combination of experimental and modeling approaches, especially because the availability of large number of sequenced genomes and previously solved protein structures allows scientists to model protein structure on the structures of previously solved homologs.

Because protein structure is closely linked with protein function, the structural genomics has the potential to inform knowledge of protein function. In addition to elucidating protein functions, structural genomics can be used to identify novel protein folds and potential targets for drug discovery. Structural genomics involves taking a large number of approaches to structure determination, including experimental methods using genomic sequences or modeling-based approaches based on sequence or structural homology to a protein of known structure or based on chemical and physical principles for a protein with no homology to any known structure.

As opposed to traditional structural biology, the determination of a protein structure through a structural genomics effort often (but not always) comes before anything is known regarding the protein function. This raises new challenges in structural bioinformatics, i.e. determining protein function from its 3D structure.

Structural genomics emphasizes high throughput determination of protein structures. This is performed in dedicated centers of structural genomics.

While most structural biologists pursue structures of individual proteins or protein groups, specialists in structural genomics pursue structures of proteins on a genome wide scale. This implies large-scale cloning, expression and purification. One main advantage of this approach is economy of scale. On the other hand, the scientific value of some resultant structures is at times questioned. A Science article from January 2006 analyzes the structural genomics field.

One advantage of structural genomics, such as the Protein Structure Initiative, is that the scientific community gets immediate access to new structures, as well as to reagents such as clones and protein. A disadvantage is that many of these structures are of proteins of unknown function and do not have corresponding publications. This requires new ways of communicating this structural information to the broader research community. The Bioinformatics core of the Joint center for structural genomics (JCSG) has recently developed a wiki-based approach namely Open protein structure annotation network (TOPSAN) for annotating protein structures emerging from high-throughput structural genomics centers."

What are a couple of simple tricks to make a simple wood carving look more polished and professional?,"Okay the first obvious point to make here is that the thing that will make any piece of art - including a wood carving - look more professional is the quality of the art!  That means the skill and the artistic quality that goes into it, specifically.  But there are a couple things you can do to dress it up a bit - think about your school days and sliding that english paper into a fresh new folder with a carefully penned title on the front. So back to wood carving.  What can you do?  Let's say you've carved yourself a nice salmon complete with fens and gill lines.  Well here are three ways to dress it up.  First and most obvious  - paint it.  You can go for detail paint or you can use more of a water color approach that will give the wood a colored wash.  The sky is really the limit here.  Second, you mount it on a stand so it floats about the ground.  Drill a small whole in the bottom of the fish, do the same in a wood block you've sanded up and you have s stand.  Third and a bit more out there - consider if there are simple additions you can add.  I made an angler fish and used a drive flower with stem as the attached antenna.  Look around and think about what you can add to your project.  Last and most basic, put a coat of varnish on it to seal it up - and if you choose give it a bit of shine.  All these ideas will give a little bit of extra finish and pop to your project."

What is geomorphometry?,"Geomorphometry, or geomorphometrics, is the science and practice of measuring the characteristics of terrain, the shape of the surface of the Earth, and the effects of this surface form on human and natural geography. It gathers various mathematical, statistical and image processing techniques that can be used to quantify morphological, hydrological, ecological and other aspects of a land surface. Common synonyms for geomorphometry are geomorphological analysis (after geomorphology), terrain morphometry, terrain analysis, and land surface analysis. Geomorphometrics is the discipline based on the computational measures of the geometry, topography and shape of the Earth's horizons, and their temporal change. This is a major component of geographic information systems (GIS) and other software tools for spatial analysis.

In simple terms, geomorphometry aims at extracting (land) surface parameters (morphometric, hydrological, climatic etc.) and objects (watersheds, stream networks, landforms etc.) using input digital land surface model (also known as digital elevation model, DEM) and parameterization software.[Extracted surface parameters and objects can then be used, for example, to improve mapping and modelling of soils, vegetation, land use, geomorphological and geological features and similar.

With the rapid increase of sources of DEMs today (and especially due to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and LIDAR-based projects), extraction of land surface parameters is becoming more and more attractive to numerous fields ranging from precision agriculture, soil-landscape modelling, climatic and hydrological applications to urban planning, education and space research. The topography of almost all Earth has been today sampled or scanned, so that DEMs are available at resolutions of 100 m or better at global scale. Land surface parameters are today successfully used for both stochastic and process-based modelling, the only remaining issue being the level of detail and vertical accuracy of the DEM."
